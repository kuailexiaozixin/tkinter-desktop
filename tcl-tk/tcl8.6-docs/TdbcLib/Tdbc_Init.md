### NAME

Tdbc_Init, Tdbc_MapSqlState, Tdbc_TokenizeSql — C procedures to facilitate
writing TDBC drivers

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tdbc.h>**  
  
int  
**Tdbc_Init**(*interp*)  
  
[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) *  
**Tdbc_TokenizeSql**(*interp, sqlcode*)  
  
const char *  
**Tdbc_MapSqlState**(*state*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in/out)     Pointer to a Tcl
interpreter.

const char ***state** (in)     Pointer to a character string containing a 'SQL
state' from a database error.

const char ***sqlcode** (in)     Pointer to a character string containing a SQL
statement.

### DESCRIPTION

The TDBC library provides several C procedures that simplify writing a TDBC
driver. They include a procedure that tokenizes a SQL statement, locating
variables to be substituted, and a procedure that accepts a SQL state and
returns an error class for the interpreter error information.

**Tdbc_Init** must be invoked prior to any other TDBC call. It accepts a
pointer to a Tcl interpreter, and arranges to load the TDBC library. It returns
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if the Tcl library was loaded successfully,
and **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** otherwise. If
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned, the interpreter's result
contains the error message.

**Tdbc_TokenizeSql** accepts a pointer to a Tcl interpreter, and a pointer to a
character string containing one or more SQL statements. It tokenizes the SQL
statements, and returns a pointer to a [Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) that
contains a list of the tokens that make up the statement. Concatenating the
tokens together will yield the original SQL code. The returned
[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) has a reference count of zero. The caller is
responsible for managing the reference count as needed. See **TOKENS** below
for a description of what may be in the returned list of tokens.

**Tdbc_MapSqlState** accepts a pointer to a string, usually five characters
long, that is the 'SQL state' that resulted from a database error. It returns a
character string that is suitable for inclusion as the error class when
constructing the error code for an error in a TDBC driver. (By convention, the
error code is a list having at least four elements:
"**[TDBC](../TdbcCmd/tdbc.md)** *errorClass* *sqlstate* *driverName*
*details...* ".)

### TOKENS

Each token returned from **Tdbc_TokenizeSql** may be one of the following:

  1. A bound variable, which begins with one of the characters '**:** ', '**@** ', or '**$** '. The remainder of the string is the variable name and will consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores. (The leading character will be be non-numeric.) 

  2. A semicolon that separates two SQL statements. 

  3. Something else in a SQL statement. The tokenizer does not attempt to parse SQL; it merely identifies bound variables (distinguishing them from similar strings appearing inside quotes or comments) and statement delimiters.
