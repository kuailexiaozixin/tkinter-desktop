### DESCRIPTION

Every database driver for TDBC (Tcl DataBase Connectivity) implements a *result
set* object that represents a the results returned from executing SQL statement
in a database. Instances of this object are created by executing the
**execute** object command on a statement object.

The **columns** object command returns a list of the names of the columns in
the result set. The columns will appear in the same order as they appeared in
the SQL statement that performed the database query. If the SQL statement does
not return a set of columns (for instance, if it is an INSERT, UPDATE, or
DELETE statement), the **columns** command will return an empty list.

The **rowcount** object command returns the number of rows in the database that
were affected by the execution of an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement. For a
SELECT statement, the row count is unspecified.

The **nextlist** object command sets the variable given by *varname* in the
caller's scope to the next row of the results, expressed as a list of column
values. NULL values are replaced by empty strings. The columns of the result
row appear in the same order in which they appeared on the SELECT statement.
The return of **nextlist** is **1** if the operation succeeded, and **0** if
the end of the result set was reached.

The **nextdict** object command sets the variable given by *varname* in the
caller's scope to the next row of the results, expressed as a dictionary. The
dictionary's keys are column names, and the values are the values of those
columns in the row. If a column's value in the row is NULL, its key is omitted
from the dictionary. The keys appear in the dictionary in the same order in
which the columns appeared on the SELECT statement. The return of **nextdict**
is **1** if the operation succeeded, and **0** if the end of the result set was
reached.

The **nextrow** object command is precisely equivalent to the **nextdict** or
**nextlist** object command, depending on whether **-as dicts** (the default)
or **-as lists** is specified.

Some databases support the idea of a single statement that returns multiple
sets of results. The **nextresults** object command is executed, typically
after the **nextlist** of **nextdict** object command has returned **0** , to
advance to the next result set. It returns **1** if there is another result set
to process, and **0** if the result set just processed was the last. After
calling **nextresults** and getting the return value of **1** , the caller may
once again call **columns** to get the column descriptions of the next result
set, and then return to calling **nextdict** or **nextlist** to process the
rows of the next result set. It is an error to call **columns** , **nextdict**
, **nextlist** or **nextrow** after **nextresults** has returned **0**.

The **allrows** object command sets the variable designated by the
**-columnsvariable** option (if present) to the result of the **columns**
object command. It then executes the **nextrow** object command repeatedly
until the end of the result set is reached. If **nextresults** returns a
nonzero value, it executes the above two steps (**columns** followed by
iterated **nextrow** calls) as long as further results are available. The rows
returned by **nextrow** are assembled into a Tcl list and become the return
value of the **allrows** command; the last value returned from **columns** is
what the application will see in **-columnsvariable**.

The **[foreach](../TclCmd/foreach.md)** object command sets the variable
designated by the **-columnsvariable** option (if present) to the result of the
**columns** object command. It then executes the **nextrow** object command
repeatedly until the end of the result set is reached, storing the successive
rows in the variable designated by *varName*. For each row, it executes the
given *script*. If the script terminates with an error, the error is reported
by the **[foreach](../TclCmd/foreach.md)** command, and iteration stops. If
the script performs a **[break](../TclCmd/break.md)** operation, the iteration
terminates prematurely. If the script performs a
**[continue](../TclCmd/continue.md)** operation, the iteration recommences
with the next row. If the script performs a **[return](../TclCmd/return.md)**
, results are the same as if a script outside the control of
**[foreach](../TclCmd/foreach.md)** had returned. Any other unusual return
code terminates the iteration and is reported from the
**[foreach](../TclCmd/foreach.md)**.

Once **nextrow** returns **0** , the **[foreach](../TclCmd/foreach.md)**
object command tries to advance to the next result set using **nextresults**.
If **nextresults** returns **1** , the above steps (**columns** and **nextrow**
, with script invocation) are repeated as long as more result sets remain. The
*script* will always see the correct description of the columns of the current
result set in the variable designated byt **-columnsvariable**. At the end of
the call, the variable designated by **-columnsvariable** will have the
description of the columns of the last result set.

The **[close](../TclCmd/close.md)** object command deletes the result set and
frees any associated system resources.
