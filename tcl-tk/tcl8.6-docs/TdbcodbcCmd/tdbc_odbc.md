tdbc::odbc — TDBC-ODBC bridge

### SYNOPSIS

package require **tdbc::odbc 1.0**  
**tdbc::odbc::connection create** *db* *connectionString* ?*-option value...*?  
**tdbc::odbc::connection new** *connectionString* ?*-option value...*?  
**tdbc::odbc::datasources** ?**-system** |**-user**?  
**tdbc::odbc::drivers**  
**tdbc::odbc::datasource** *command* *driverName* ?*keyword* -*value*?...  

### DESCRIPTION

The **tdbc::odbc** driver provides a database interface that conforms to Tcl
DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect to any SQL
database presenting an ODBC interface. It is also provided as a worked example
of how to write a database driver in C, so that driver authors have a starting
point for further development.

Connection to an ODBC database is established by invoking
**tdbc::odbc::connection create** , passing it the name to be used as a
connection handle, followed by a standard ODBC connection string. As an
alternative, **tdbc::odbc::connection new** may be used to create a database
connection with an automatically assigned name. The return value from
**tdbc::odbc::connection new** is the name that was chosen for the connection
handle.

The connection string will include at least a **DRIVER** or **DSN** keyword,
and may include others that are defined by a particular ODBC driver. (If the
local ODBC system supports a graphical user interface, the **-parent** option
(see below) may allow calling **tdbc::odbc::connection create** with an empty
connection string.)

The side effect of **tdbc::odbc::connection create** is to create a new
database connection.. See **tdbc::connection(n)** for the details of how to use
the connection to manipulate a database.

In addition to a standard TDBC interface, **tdbc::odbc** supports three
additional ccommands. The first of these, **tdbc::odbc::datasources** , which
returns a Tcl list enumerating the named data sources available to the program
(for connection with the **DSN** keyword in the connection string). The result
of **tdbc::odbc::datasources** may be constrained to only system data sources
or only user data sources by including the **-system** or **-user** options,
respectively.

The **tdbc::odbc::drivers** command returns a dictionary whose keys are the
names of drivers available for the **DRIVER** keyword in the connection string,
and whose values are descriptions of the drivers.

The **tdbc::odbc::datasource** command allows configuration of named data
sources on those systems that support the ODBC Installer application
programming interface. It accepts a *command* , which specifies the operation
to be performed, the name of a *driver* for the database in question, and a set
of keyword-value pairs that are interpreted by the given driver. The *command*
must be one of the following:

**add**     Adds a user data source. The keyword-value pairs must include at
least a **DSN** option naming the data source

**add_system**     Adds a system data source. The keyword-value pairs must
include at least a **DSN** option naming the data source

**configure**     Configures a user data source. The keyword-value pairs will
usually include a **DSN** option naming the data source. Some drivers will
support other options, such as the **CREATE_DB** option to the Microsoft Access
driver on Windows.

**configure_system**     Configures a system data source.

**remove**     Removes a user data source. The keyword-value pairs must include
a **DSN** option specifying the data source to remove.

**remove_system**     Removes a system data source. The keyword-value pairs
must include a **DSN** option specifying the data source to remove.

### CONNECTION OPTIONS

The **tdbc::odbc::connection create** object command supports the **-encoding**
, **-isolation** , **-readonly** and **-timeout** options common to all TDBC
drivers. The **-encoding** option will succeed only if the requested encoding
is the same as the system encoding; **tdbc::odbc** does not attempt to specify
alternative encodings to an ODBC driver. (Some drivers accept encoding
specifications in the connection string.)

In addition, if Tk is present in the requesting interpreter, and the local
system's ODBC driver manager supports a graphical user interface, the
**tdbc::odbc::connection create** object command supports a **-parent** option,
whose value is the path name of a Tk window. If this option is specified, and a
connection string does not specify all the information needed to connect to an
interface, the ODBC driver manager will display a dialog box to request
whatever additional information is required. The requesting interpreter will
block until the user dismisses the dialog, at which point the connection is
made.

### EXAMPLES

Sincs ODBC connection strings are driver specific, it is often difficult to
find the documentation needed to compose them. The following examples are known
to work on most Windows systems and provide at least a few useful things that a
program can do.

    
    
    tdbc::odbc::connection create db \
        "DSN={PAYROLL};UID={aladdin};PWD={Sesame}"

Connects to a named data source "PAYROLL", providing "aladdin" as a user name
and "Sesame" as a password. Uses **db** as the name of the connection.

    
    
    set connString {DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};}
    append connString {FIL={MS Access}\;}
    append connString {DBQ=} \
        [file nativename [file normalize $fileName]]
    tdbc::odbc::connection create db2 -readonly 1 $connString

Opens a connection to a Microsoft Access database file whose name is in
*$fileName*. The database is opened in read-only mode. The resulting connection
is called "db2".

    
    
    tdbc::odbc::connection create db3 \
        "DRIVER=SQLite3;DATABASE=$fileName"

Opens a connection to a SQLite3 database whose name is in "$fileName".

    
    
    tdbc::odbc::datasource add \
        {Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)} \
        DSN=MyTestDatabase \
        DBQ=[file native [file normalize $fileName]]

Creates a new user data source with the name, "MyTestDatabase" bound to a
Microsoft Access file whose path name is in "$fileName". No connection is made
to the data source until the program calls **tdbc::odbc::connection create**.

    
    
    tdbc::odbc::datasource configure \
        {Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)} \
        CREATE_DB=[file native [file normalize $fileName]] \
        General

Creates a new, empty Microsoft Access database in the file identified by
"$fileName". No connection is made to the database until the program calls
**tdbc::odbc::connection create**.

### ADDITIONAL CONNECTION METHODS

In addition to the usual methods on the tdbc::connection(n) object, connections
to an ODBC database support one additional method:

*$connection* **evaldirect** *sqlStatement*     This method takes the given driver-native SQL code *sqlStatement* and evaluates it without preparing it. The statement is not tokenized and must not contain variable substitutions. Evaluating the *sqlStatement* produces a result set of zero or more rows. The result of the command is a list of dictionaries, with one list element per row in the result set (in a similar format to the list returned by *$connection allrows -as dicts*). *This command is not recommended* for anything where the usual *prepare* or *preparecall* methods work correctly. It is provided so that data management language statements that are not implemented by the driver's prepared statement API (such as **CREATE DATABASE** or **CREATE PROCEDURE**), or that contain characters that are reserved by the tokenizer, can be executed.
