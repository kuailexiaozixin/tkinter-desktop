### NAME

Tk_GetColormap, Tk_PreserveColormap, Tk_FreeColormap — allocate and free
colormaps

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
Colormap  
**Tk_GetColormap(***interp, tkwin, string***)**  
**Tk_PreserveColormap(***display, colormap***)**  
**Tk_FreeColormap(***display, colormap***)**  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter to use for
error reporting.

[Tk_Window](../TkLib/WindowId.md) **tkwin** (in)     Token for window in which
colormap will be used.

const char ***string** (in)     Selects a colormap: either **new** or the name
of a window with the same screen and visual as *tkwin*.

Display ***display** (in)     Display for which *colormap* was allocated.

Colormap **colormap** (in)     Colormap to free or preserve; must have been
returned by a previous call to **Tk_GetColormap** or
**[Tk_GetVisual](../TkLib/GetVisual.md)**.

### DESCRIPTION

These procedures are used to manage colormaps. **Tk_GetColormap** returns a
colormap suitable for use in *tkwin*. If its *string* argument is **new** then
a new colormap is created; otherwise *string* must be the name of another
window with the same screen and visual as *tkwin* , and the colormap from that
window is returned. If *string* does not make sense, or if it refers to a
window on a different screen from *tkwin* or with a different visual than
*tkwin* , then **Tk_GetColormap** returns **None** and leaves an error message
in *interp* 's result.

**Tk_PreserveColormap** increases the internal reference count for a colormap
previously returned by **Tk_GetColormap** , which allows the colormap to be
stored in several locations without knowing which order they will be released.

**Tk_FreeColormap** should be called when a colormap returned by
**Tk_GetColormap** is no longer needed. Tk maintains a reference count for each
colormap returned by **Tk_GetColormap** , so there should eventually be one
call to **Tk_FreeColormap** for each call to **Tk_GetColormap** and each call
to **Tk_PreserveColormap**. When a colormap's reference count becomes zero, Tk
releases the X colormap.

**[Tk_GetVisual](../TkLib/GetVisual.md)** and **Tk_GetColormap** work
together, in that a new colormap created by
**[Tk_GetVisual](../TkLib/GetVisual.md)** may later be returned by
**Tk_GetColormap**. The reference counting mechanism for colormaps includes
both procedures, so callers of **[Tk_GetVisual](../TkLib/GetVisual.md)** must
also call **Tk_FreeColormap** to release the colormap. If **Tk_GetColormap** is
called with a *string* value of **new** then the resulting colormap will never
be returned by **[Tk_GetVisual](../TkLib/GetVisual.md)** ; however, it can be
used in other windows by calling **Tk_GetColormap** with the original window's
name as *string*.
