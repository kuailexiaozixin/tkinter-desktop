### NAME

Tk_CanvasPsY, Tk_CanvasPsBitmap, Tk_CanvasPsColor, Tk_CanvasPsFont,
Tk_CanvasPsPath, Tk_CanvasPsStipple — utility procedures for generating
Postscript for canvases

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
double  
**Tk_CanvasPsY**(*canvas, canvasY*)  
int  
**Tk_CanvasPsBitmap**(*interp, canvas, bitmap, x, y, width, height*)  
int  
**Tk_CanvasPsColor**(*interp, canvas, colorPtr*)  
int  
**Tk_CanvasPsFont**(*interp, canvas, tkFont*)  
**Tk_CanvasPsPath**(*interp, canvas, coordPtr, numPoints*)  
int  
**Tk_CanvasPsStipple**(*interp, canvas, bitmap*)  

### ARGUMENTS

Tk_Canvas **[canvas](../TkCmd/canvas.md)** (in)     A token that identifies a
canvas widget for which Postscript is being generated.

double **canvasY** (in)     Y-coordinate in the space of the canvas.

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in/out)     A Tcl interpreter;
Postscript is appended to its result, or the result may be replaced with an
error message.

Pixmap **[bitmap](../TkCmd/bitmap.md)** (in)     Bitmap to use for generating
Postscript.

int **x** (in)     X-coordinate within *bitmap* of left edge of region to
output.

int **y** (in)     Y-coordinate within *bitmap* of top edge of region to
output.

int **width** (in)     Width of region of bitmap to output, in pixels.

int **height** (in)     Height of region of bitmap to output, in pixels.

XColor ***colorPtr** (in)     Information about color value to set in
Postscript.

[Tk_Font](../TkLib/GetFont.md) **tkFont** (in)     Font for which Postscript
is to be generated.

double ***coordPtr** (in)     Pointer to an array of coordinates for one or
more points specified in canvas coordinates. The order of values in *coordPtr*
is x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, and so on.

int **numPoints** (in)     Number of points at *coordPtr*.

### DESCRIPTION

These procedures are called by canvas type managers to carry out common
functions related to generating Postscript. Most of the procedures take a
*canvas* argument, which refers to a canvas widget for which Postscript is
being generated.

**Tk_CanvasPsY** takes as argument a y-coordinate in the space of a canvas and
returns the value that should be used for that point in the Postscript
currently being generated for *canvas*. Y coordinates require transformation
because Postscript uses an origin at the lower-left corner whereas X uses an
origin at the upper-left corner. Canvas x coordinates can be used directly in
Postscript without transformation.

**Tk_CanvasPsBitmap** generates Postscript to describe a region of a bitmap.
The Postscript is generated in proper image data format for Postscript, i.e.,
as data between angle brackets, one bit per pixel. The Postscript is appended
to the result of interpreter *interp* and **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is
returned unless an error occurs, in which case
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned and the interpreter result is
overwritten with an error message.

**Tk_CanvasPsColor** generates Postscript to set the current color to
correspond to its *colorPtr* argument, taking into account any color map
specified in the **postscript** command. It appends the Postscript to the
interpreter *interp* 's result and returns **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)**
unless an error occurs, in which case **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is
returned and the interpreter's result is overwritten with an error message.

**Tk_CanvasPsFont** generates Postscript that sets the current font to match
*tkFont* as closely as possible. **Tk_CanvasPsFont** takes into account any
font map specified in the **postscript** command, and it does the best it can
at mapping X fonts to Postscript fonts. It appends the Postscript to
interpreter *interp* 's result and returns **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)**
unless an error occurs, in which case **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is
returned and the interpreter's result is overwritten with an error message.

**Tk_CanvasPsPath** generates Postscript to set the current path to the set of
points given by *coordPtr* and *numPoints*. It appends the resulting Postscript
to the result of interpreter *interp*.

**Tk_CanvasPsStipple** generates Postscript that will fill the current path in
stippled fashion. It uses *bitmap* as the stipple pattern and the current
Postscript color; ones in the stipple bitmap are drawn in the current color,
and zeroes are not drawn at all. The Postscript is appended to interpreter
*interp* 's result and **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned, unless an
error occurs, in which case **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned
and the interpreter's result is overwritten with an error message.
