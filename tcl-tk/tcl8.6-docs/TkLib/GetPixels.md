### NAME

Tk_GetPixelsFromObj, Tk_GetPixels, Tk_GetMMFromObj, Tk_GetScreenMM — translate
between strings and screen units

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
int  
**Tk_GetPixelsFromObj(***interp, tkwin, objPtr, intPtr***)**  
int  
**Tk_GetPixels(***interp, tkwin, string, intPtr***)**  
int  
**Tk_GetMMFromObj(***interp, tkwin, objPtr, doublePtr***)**  
int  
**Tk_GetScreenMM(***interp, tkwin, string, doublePtr***)**  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter to use for
error reporting.

[Tk_Window](../TkLib/WindowId.md) **tkwin** (in)     Window whose screen
geometry determines the conversion between absolute units and pixels.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ***objPtr** (in/out)     String value specifies
a distance on the screen; internal rep will be modified to cache converted
distance.

const char ***string** (in)     Same as *objPtr* except specification of
distance is passed as a string.

int ***intPtr** (out)     Pointer to location in which to store converted
distance in pixels.

double ***doublePtr** (out)     Pointer to location in which to store converted
distance in millimeters.

### DESCRIPTION

These procedures take as argument a specification of distance on the screen
(*objPtr* or *string*) and compute the corresponding distance either in integer
pixels or floating-point millimeters. In either case, *objPtr* or *string*
specifies a screen distance as a floating-point number followed by one of the
following characters that indicates units:

<none>     The number specifies a distance in pixels.

**c**     The number specifies a distance in centimeters on the screen.

**i**     The number specifies a distance in inches on the screen.

**m**     The number specifies a distance in millimeters on the screen.

**p**     The number specifies a distance in printer's points (1/72 inch) on
the screen.

**Tk_GetPixelsFromObj** converts the value of *objPtr* to the nearest even
number of pixels and stores that value at **intPtr*. It returns
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** under normal circumstances. If an error
occurs (e.g. *objPtr* contains a number followed by a character that is not one
of the ones above) then **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned and an
error message is left in *interp* 's result if *interp* is not NULL.
**Tk_GetPixelsFromObj** caches information about the return value in *objPtr* ,
which speeds up future calls to **Tk_GetPixelsFromObj** with the same *objPtr*.

**Tk_GetPixels** is identical to **Tk_GetPixelsFromObj** except that the screen
distance is specified with a string instead of an object. This prevents
**Tk_GetPixels** from caching the return value, so **Tk_GetPixels** is less
efficient than **Tk_GetPixelsFromObj**.

**Tk_GetMMFromObj** and **Tk_GetScreenMM** are similar to
**Tk_GetPixelsFromObj** and **Tk_GetPixels** (respectively) except that they
convert the screen distance to millimeters and store a double-precision
floating-point result at **doublePtr*.
