### NAME

Tk_GetSelection — retrieve the contents of a selection

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
int  
**Tk_GetSelection**(*interp, tkwin, selection, target, proc, clientData*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter to use for
reporting errors.

[Tk_Window](../TkLib/WindowId.md) **tkwin** (in)     Window on whose behalf to
retrieve the selection (determines display from which to retrieve).

Atom **[selection](../TkCmd/selection.md)** (in)     The name of the selection
to be retrieved.

Atom **target** (in)     Form in which to retrieve selection.

Tk_GetSelProc ***proc** (in)     Procedure to invoke to process pieces of the
selection as they are retrieved.

ClientData **clientData** (in)     Arbitrary one-word value to pass to *proc*.

### DESCRIPTION

**Tk_GetSelection** retrieves the selection specified by the atom *selection*
in the format specified by *target*. The selection may actually be retrieved in
several pieces; as each piece is retrieved, *proc* is called to process the
piece. *Proc* should have arguments and result that match the type
**Tk_GetSelProc** :

    
    
    typedef int **Tk_GetSelProc**(
            ClientData *clientData* ,
            [Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) **interp* ,
            char **portion*);

The *clientData* and *interp* parameters to *proc* will be copies of the
corresponding arguments to **Tk_GetSelection**. *Portion* will be a pointer to
a string containing part or all of the selection. For large selections, *proc*
will be called several times with successive portions of the selection. The X
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual allows a selection to be returned
in formats other than strings, e.g. as an array of atoms or integers. If this
happens, Tk converts the selection back into a string before calling *proc*. If
a selection is returned as an array of atoms, Tk converts it to a string
containing the atom names separated by white space. For any other format
besides string, Tk converts a selection to a string containing hexadecimal
values separated by white space.

**Tk_GetSelection** returns to its caller when the selection has been
completely retrieved and processed by *proc* , or when a fatal error has
occurred (e.g. the selection owner did not respond promptly).
**Tk_GetSelection** normally returns **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** ; if an
error occurs, it returns **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and leaves an
error message in interpreter *interp* 's result. *Proc* should also return
either **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** or
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)**. If *proc* encounters an error in dealing
with the selection, it should leave an error message in the interpreter result
and return **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** ; this will abort the selection
retrieval.
