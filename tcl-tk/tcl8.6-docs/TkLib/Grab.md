### NAME

Tk_Grab, Tk_Ungrab — manipulate grab state in an application

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
int  
**Tk_Grab**(*interp, tkwin, grabGlobal*)  
void  
**Tk_Ungrab**(*tkwin*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter to use for
error reporting

[Tk_Window](../TkLib/WindowId.md) **tkwin** (in)     Window on whose behalf
the pointer is to be grabbed or released

int **grabGlobal** (in)     Boolean indicating whether the grab is global or
application local

### DESCRIPTION

These functions are used to set or release a global or application local grab.
When a grab is set on a particular window in a Tk application, mouse and
keyboard events can only be received by that window and its descendants. Mouse
and keyboard events for windows outside the tree rooted at *tkwin* will be
redirected to *tkwin*. If the grab is global, then all mouse and keyboard
events for windows outside the tree rooted at *tkwin* (even those intended for
windows in other applications) will be redirected to *tkwin*. If the grab is
application local, only mouse and keyboard events intended for a windows within
the same application (but outside the tree rooted at *tkwin*) will be
redirected.

**Tk_Grab** sets a grab on a particular window. *Tkwin* specifies the window on
whose behalf the pointer is to be grabbed. *GrabGlobal* indicates whether the
grab should be global or application local; if it is non-zero, it means the
grab should be global. Normally, **Tk_Grab** returns
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** ; if an error occurs and the grab cannot be
set, **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned and an error message is
left if *interp* 's result. Once this call completes successfully, no window
outside the tree rooted at *tkwin* will receive pointer- or keyboard-related
events until the next call to Tk_Ungrab. If a previous grab was in effect
within the application, then it is replaced with a new one.

**Tk_Ungrab** releases a grab on the mouse pointer and keyboard, if there is
one set on the window given by *tkwin*. Once a grab is released, pointer and
keyboard events will start being delivered to other windows again.
