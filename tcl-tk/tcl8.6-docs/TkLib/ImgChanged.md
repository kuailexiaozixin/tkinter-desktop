### NAME

Tk_ImageChanged — notify widgets that image needs to be redrawn

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
**Tk_ImageChanged**(*model, x, y, width, height, imageWidth, imageHeight*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tk_ImageMaster](../TkLib/GetImage.md) **model** (in)     Token for image,
which was passed to image's *createProc* when the image was created.

int **x** (in)     X-coordinate of upper-left corner of region that needs
redisplay (measured from upper-left corner of image).

int **y** (in)     Y-coordinate of upper-left corner of region that needs
redisplay (measured from upper-left corner of image).

int **width** (in)     Width of region that needs to be redrawn, in pixels.

int **height** (in)     Height of region that needs to be redrawn, in pixels.

int **imageWidth** (in)     Current width of image, in pixels.

int **imageHeight** (in)     Current height of image, in pixels.

### DESCRIPTION

An image manager calls **Tk_ImageChanged** for an image whenever anything
happens that requires the image to be redrawn. As a result of calling
**Tk_ImageChanged** , any widgets using the image are notified so that they can
redisplay themselves appropriately. The *model* argument identifies the image,
and *x* , *y* , *width* , and *height* specify a rectangular region within the
image that needs to be redrawn. *imageWidth* and *imageHeight* specify the
image's (new) size.

*[Tk_ImageModel](../TkLib/GetImage.md)* is synonym for *[Tk_ImageMaster](../TkLib/GetImage.md)*

An image manager should call **Tk_ImageChanged** during its *createProc* to
specify the image's initial size and to force redisplay if there are existing
instances for the image. If any of the pixel values in the image should change
later on, **Tk_ImageChanged** should be called again with *x* , *y* , *width* ,
and *height* values that cover all the pixels that changed. If the size of the
image should change, then **Tk_ImageChanged** must be called to indicate the
new size, even if no pixels need to be redisplayed.
