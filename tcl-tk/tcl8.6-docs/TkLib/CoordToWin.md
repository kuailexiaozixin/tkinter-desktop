### NAME

Tk_CoordsToWindow — Find window containing a point

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
[Tk_Window](../TkLib/WindowId.md)  
**Tk_CoordsToWindow**(*rootX, rootY, tkwin*)  

### ARGUMENTS

int **rootX** (in)     X-coordinate (in root window coordinates).

int **rootY** (in)     Y-coordinate (in root window coordinates).

[Tk_Window](../TkLib/WindowId.md) **tkwin** (in)     Token for window that
identifies application.

### DESCRIPTION

**Tk_CoordsToWindow** locates the window that contains a given point. The point
is specified in root coordinates with *rootX* and *rootY* (if a virtual-root
window manager is in use then *rootX* and *rootY* are in the coordinate system
of the virtual root window). The return value from the procedure is a token for
the window that contains the given point. If the point is not in any window, or
if the containing window is not in the same application as *tkwin* , then NULL
is returned.

The containing window is decided using the same rules that determine which
window contains the mouse cursor: if a parent and a child both contain the
point then the child gets preference, and if two siblings both contain the
point then the highest one in the stacking order (i.e. the one that's visible
on the screen) gets preference.
