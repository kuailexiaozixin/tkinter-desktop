### NAME

itcl::component — define components for extendedclass, widget or widgetadaptor

Parts of this description are "borrowed" from Tcl extension [snit], as the
functionality is mostly identical.

### WARNING!

This is new functionality in [incr Tcl] where the API can still change!!

### SYNOPSIS

**public component** *comp* ?**-inherit**?  
**protected component** *comp* ?**-inherit**?  
**private component** *comp* ?**-inherit**?  

### DESCRIPTION

The **component** command is used inside an **[incr  Tcl]**
extendedclass/widget/widgetadaptor definition to define components.

Explicitly declares a component called comp, and automatically defines the
component's instance variable.

If the *-inherit* option is specified then all unknown methods and options will
be delegated to this component. The name -inherit implies that instances of
this new type inherit, in a sense, the methods and options of the component.
That is, -inherit yes is equivalent to:

    
    
    component mycomp
    delegate option * to mycomp
    delegate method * to mycomp
