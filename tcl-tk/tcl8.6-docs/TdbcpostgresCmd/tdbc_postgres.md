### NAME

tdbc::postgres — TDBC-POSTGRES bridge

### SYNOPSIS

package require **tdbc::postgres 1.0**  
**tdbc::postgres::connection create** *db* ?*-option value...*?  
**tdbc::postgres::connection new** ?*-option value...*?  

### DESCRIPTION

The **tdbc::postgres** driver provides a database interface that conforms to
Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect to a
Postgres database.

Connection to a POSTGRES database is established by invoking
**tdbc::postgres::connection create** , passing it the name to give the
database handle and a set of *-option-value* pairs. The available options are
enumerated under CONNECTION OPTIONS below. As an alternative,
**tdbc::postgres::connection new** may be used to create a database connection
with an automatically assigned name. The return value from
**tdbc::postgres::connection new** is the name that was chosen for the
connection handle.

The side effect of **tdbc::postgres::connection create** is to create a new
database connection.. See **tdbc::connection(n)** for the details of how to use
the connection to manipulate a database.

### CONNECTION OPTIONS

The **tdbc::postgres::connection create** object command supports the
**-encoding** , **-isolation** , **-readonly** and **-timeout** options common
to all TDBC drivers. The **-timeout** option will only affect connection
process, once connected this value will be ignored and cannot be changed after
connecting.

In addition, the following options are recognized (these options must be set on
the initial creation of the connection; they cannot be changed after
connecting) :

**-host** *hostname*     Connects to the host specified by *hostname*. Default
is to connect using a local Unix domain socket.

**-hostaddr** *address*     Connects to the host specified by given IP
*address*. If both **-host** and **-hostaddr** are given, the value of
**-host** is ignored. Default is to connect using a local Unix domain socket.

**-port** *number*     Connects to a Postgres server listening on the port
specified by *number*. It is used only when *host* or *hostaddr* is specified.

**-user** *name*     Presents *name* as the user name to the Postgres server.
Default is the current user ID.

**-passwd** *password*  

**-password** *password*     These two options are synonymous. They present the
given *password* as the user's password to the Postgres server. Default is not
to present a password.

**-database** *name*  

**-db** *name*     These two options are synonymous. They present the given
*name* as the name of the default database to use in Postgres queries. If not
specified, the default database for the current user is used.

**-options** *opts*     This sets *opts* as additional command line options
send to the server.

**-tty** *file*     This option is ignored on never servers. Formerly this
specified where to send debug output. This option is left for compatibility
with older servers.

**-sslmode** *mode*     This option determines whether or with what priority an
SSL connection will be negotiated with the server. There are four *modes* :
**disable** will attempt only an unencrypted SSL connection; **allow** will
negotiate, trying first a non-SSL connection, then if that fails, trying an SSL
connection; **prefer** (the default) will negotiate, trying first an SSL
connection, then if that fails, trying a regular non-SSL connection;
**require** will try only an SSL connection. If PostgreSQL is compiled without
SSL support, using option **require** will cause an error, and options
**allow** and **prefer** will be tolerated but the driver will be unable to
negotiate an SSL connection.

**-requiressl** *flag*     This option is deprecated in favor of the
**-sslmode** setting. The *flag* value must be a Boolean value. If it is
**true** (or any equivalent), driver will then refuse to connect if the server
does not accept an SSL connection. The default value is **false** (or any
equivalent), and acts the same like **-sslmode** **preffered**

**-service** *name*     It specifies a service *name* in pg_service.conf file
that holds additional connection parameters. This allows applications to
specify only a service name so connection parameters can be centrally
maintained. Refer to PostgreSQL Documentation or
PREFIX/share/pg_service.conf.sample file for details.

### EXAMPLES

    
    
    tdbc::postgres::connection -user joe -passwd sesame -db joes_database

Connects to the Postgres server on the local host using the default connection
method, presenting user ID 'joe' and password 'sesame'. Uses 'joes_database' as
the default database name.
