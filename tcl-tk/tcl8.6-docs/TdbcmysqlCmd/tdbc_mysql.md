### NAME

tdbc::mysql — TDBC-MYSQL bridge

### SYNOPSIS

package require **tdbc::mysql 1.0**  
**tdbc::mysql::connection create** *db* ?*-option value...*?  
**tdbc::mysql::connection new** ?*-option value...*?  
**tdbc::mysql::datasources** ?**-system** |**-user**?  
**tdbc::mysql::drivers**  
**tdbc::mysql::datasource** *command* *driverName* ?*keyword* -*value*?...  

### DESCRIPTION

The **tdbc::mysql** driver provides a database interface that conforms to Tcl
DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect to a MySQL
database.

Connection to an MYSQL database is established by invoking
**tdbc::mysql::connection create** , passing it the name to give the database
handle and a set of *-option-value* pairs. The available options are enumerated
under CONNECTION OPTIONS below. As an alternative, **tdbc::mysql::connection
new** may be used to create a database connection with an automatically
assigned name. The return value from **tdbc::mysql::connection new** is the
name that was chosen for the connection handle.

The side effect of **tdbc::mysql::connection create** is to create a new
database connection.. See **tdbc::connection(n)** for the details of how to use
the connection to manipulate a database.

### CONNECTION OPTIONS

The **tdbc::mysql::connection create** object command supports the
**-encoding** , **-isolation** , **-readonly** and **-timeout** options common
to all TDBC drivers. The **-encoding** option will always fail unless the
encoding is **utf-8** ; the database connection always uses UTF-8 encoding to
be able to transfer arbitrary Unicode characters. The **-readonly** option must
be **0** , because MySQL does not offer read-only connections.

In addition, the following options are recognized:

**-host** *hostname*     Connects to the host specified by *hostname*. This
option must be set on the initial creation of the connection; it cannot be
changed after connecting. Default is to connect to the local host.

**-port** *number*     Connects to a MySQL server listening on the port
specified by *number*. This option may not be changed after connecting. It is
used only when *host* is specified and is not **localhost**.

**-socket** *path*     Connects to a MySQL server listening on the Unix socket
or named pipe specified by *path* . This option may not be changed after
connecting. It is used only when *-host* is not specified or is **localhost**.

**-user** *name*     Presents *name* as the user name to the MySQL server.
Default is the current user ID.

**-passwd** *password*  

**-password** *password*     These two options are synonymous. They present the
given *password* as the user's password to the MySQL server. Default is not to
present a password.

**-database** *name*  

**-db** *name*     These two options are synonymous. They present the given
*name* as the name of the default database to use in MySQL queries. If not
specified, the default database for the current user is used.

**-interactive** *flag*     The *flag* value must be a Boolean value. If it is
**true** (or any equivalent), the default timeout is set for an interactive
user, otherwise, the default timeout is set for a batch user. This option is
meaningful only on initial connection. When using the **configure** method on a
MySQL connection use the **-timeout** option to set the timeout desired.

**-ssl_ca** *string*  

**-ssl_capath** *string*  

**-ssl_cert** *string*  

**-ssl_cipher** *string*  

**-ssl_key** *string*     These five options set the certificate authority,
certificate authority search path, SSL certificate, transfer cipher, and SSL
key to the given *string* arguments. These options may be specified only on
initial connection to a database, not in the **configure** method of an
existing connection. Default is not to use SSL.

### EXAMPLES

    
    
    tdbc::mysql::connection -user joe -passwd sesame -db joes_database

Connects to the MySQL server on the local host using the default connection
method, presenting user ID 'joe' and password 'sesame'. Uses 'joes_database' as
the default database name.

### ADDITIONAL CONNECTION METHODS

In addition to the usual methods on the tdbc::connection(n) object, connections
to a MySQL database support one additional method:

*$connection* **evaldirect** *sqlStatement*     This method takes the given *sqlStatement* and interprets as MySQL native SQL code and evaluates it without preparing it. The statement may not contain variable substitutions. The result set is returned as a list of lists, with each sublist being the list of columns of a result row formatted as character strings. Note that the string formatting is done by MySQL and not by Tcl, so details like the appearance of floating point numbers may differ. *This command is not recommended* for anything where the usual *prepare* or *preparecall* methods work correctly. It is provided so that data management language statements that are not implemented in MySQL's prepared statement API, such as **CREATE DATABASE** or **CREATE PROCEDURE** , can be executed.
