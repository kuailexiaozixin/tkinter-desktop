### NAME

Tcl_CreateTimerHandler, Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler — call a procedure at a given
time

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
Tcl_TimerToken  
**Tcl_CreateTimerHandler**(*milliseconds, proc, clientData*)  
**Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler**(*token*)  

### ARGUMENTS

int **milliseconds** (in)     How many milliseconds to wait before invoking
*proc*.

Tcl_TimerProc ***proc** (in)     Procedure to invoke after *milliseconds* have
elapsed.

ClientData **clientData** (in)     Arbitrary one-word value to pass to *proc*.

Tcl_TimerToken **token** (in)     Token for previously created timer handler
(the return value from some previous call to **Tcl_CreateTimerHandler**).

### DESCRIPTION

**Tcl_CreateTimerHandler** arranges for *proc* to be invoked at a time
*milliseconds* milliseconds in the future. The callback to *proc* will be made
by **[Tcl_DoOneEvent](../TclLib/DoOneEvent.md)** , so
**Tcl_CreateTimerHandler** is only useful in programs that dispatch events
through **[Tcl_DoOneEvent](../TclLib/DoOneEvent.md)** or through Tcl commands
such as **[vwait](../TclCmd/vwait.md)**. The call to *proc* may not be made at
the exact time given by *milliseconds* : it will be made at the next
opportunity after that time. For example, if
**[Tcl_DoOneEvent](../TclLib/DoOneEvent.md)** is not called until long after
the time has elapsed, or if there are other pending events to process before
the call to *proc* , then the call to *proc* will be delayed.

*Proc* should have arguments and return value that match the type **Tcl_TimerProc** : 
    
    
    typedef void **Tcl_TimerProc**(
            ClientData *clientData*);

The *clientData* parameter to *proc* is a copy of the *clientData* argument
given to **Tcl_CreateTimerHandler** when the callback was created. Typically,
*clientData* points to a data structure containing application-specific
information about what to do in *proc*.

**Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler** may be called to delete a previously created timer
handler. It deletes the handler indicated by *token* so that no call to *proc*
will be made; if that handler no longer exists (e.g. because the time period
has already elapsed and *proc* has been invoked then **Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler**
does nothing. The tokens returned by **Tcl_CreateTimerHandler** never have a
value of NULL, so if NULL is passed to **Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler** then the
procedure does nothing.
