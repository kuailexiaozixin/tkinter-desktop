### NAME

Tcl_FindExecutable, Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable — identify or return the name of
the binary file containing the application

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
void  
**Tcl_FindExecutable**(*argv0*)  
const char *  
**Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable**()  

### ARGUMENTS

char ***argv0** (in)     The first command-line argument to the program, which
gives the application's name.

### DESCRIPTION

The **Tcl_FindExecutable** procedure computes the full path name of the
executable file from which the application was invoked and saves it for Tcl's
internal use. The executable's path name is needed for several purposes in Tcl.
For example, it is needed on some platforms in the implementation of the
**[load](../TclCmd/load.md)** command. It is also returned by the **[info
nameofexecutable](../TclCmd/info.md)** command.

On UNIX platforms this procedure is typically invoked as the very first thing
in the application's main program; it must be passed *argv[0]* as its argument.
It is important not to change the working directory before the invocation.
**Tcl_FindExecutable** uses *argv0* along with the **PATH** environment
variable to find the application's executable, if possible. If it fails to find
the binary, then future calls to **[info
nameofexecutable](../TclCmd/info.md)** will return an empty string.

On Windows platforms this procedure is typically invoked as the very first
thing in the application's main program as well; Its *argv[0]* argument is only
used to indicate whether the executable has a stderr channel (any non-null
value) or not (the value null). If **[Tcl_SetPanicProc](../TclLib/Panic.md)**
is never called and no debugger is running, this determines whether the panic
message is sent to stderr or to a standard system dialog.

**Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable** simply returns a pointer to the internal full path
name of the executable file as computed by **Tcl_FindExecutable**. This
procedure call is the C API equivalent to the **[info
nameofexecutable](../TclCmd/info.md)** command. NULL is returned if the
internal full path name has not been computed or unknown.
