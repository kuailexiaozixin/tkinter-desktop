### INTRODUCTION

This man page presents an overview of Tcl values (called **Tcl_Obj** s for
historical reasons) and how they are used. It also describes generic procedures
for managing Tcl values. These procedures are used to create and copy values,
and increment and decrement the count of references (pointers) to values. The
procedures are used in conjunction with ones that operate on specific types of
values such as **[Tcl_GetIntFromObj](../TclLib/IntObj.md)** and
**[Tcl_ListObjAppendElement](../TclLib/ListObj.md)**. The individual
procedures are described along with the data structures they manipulate.

Tcl's *dual-ported* values provide a general-purpose mechanism for storing and
exchanging Tcl values. They largely replace the use of strings in Tcl. For
example, they are used to store variable values, command arguments, command
results, and scripts. Tcl values behave like strings but also hold an internal
representation that can be manipulated more efficiently. For example, a Tcl
list is now represented as a value that holds the list's string representation
as well as an array of pointers to the values for each list element. Dual-
ported values avoid most runtime type conversions. They also improve the speed
of many operations since an appropriate representation is immediately
available. The compiler itself uses Tcl values to cache the instruction
bytecodes resulting from compiling scripts.

The two representations are a cache of each other and are computed lazily. That
is, each representation is only computed when necessary, it is computed from
the other representation, and, once computed, it is saved. In addition, a
change in one representation invalidates the other one. As an example, a Tcl
program doing integer calculations can operate directly on a variable's
internal machine integer representation without having to constantly convert
between integers and strings. Only when it needs a string representing the
variable's value, say to print it, will the program regenerate the string
representation from the integer. Although values contain an internal
representation, their semantics are defined in terms of strings: an up-to-date
string can always be obtained, and any change to the value will be reflected in
that string when the value's string representation is fetched. Because of this
representation invalidation and regeneration, it is dangerous for extension
writers to access **Tcl_Obj** fields directly. It is better to access Tcl_Obj
information using procedures like
**[Tcl_GetStringFromObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** and
**[Tcl_GetString](../TclLib/StringObj.md)**.

Values are allocated on the heap and are referenced using a pointer to their
**Tcl_Obj** structure. Values are shared as much as possible. This
significantly reduces storage requirements because some values such as long
lists are very large. Also, most Tcl values are only read and never modified.
This is especially true for procedure arguments, which can be shared between
the caller and the called procedure. Assignment and argument binding is done by
simply assigning a pointer to the value. Reference counting is used to
determine when it is safe to reclaim a value's storage.

Tcl values are typed. A value's internal representation is controlled by its
type. Several types are predefined in the Tcl core including integer, double,
list, and bytecode. Extension writers can extend the set of types by defining
their own **[Tcl_ObjType](../TclLib/ObjectType.md)** structs.

### THE TCL_OBJ STRUCTURE

Each Tcl value is represented by a **Tcl_Obj** structure which is defined as
follows.

    
    
    typedef struct Tcl_Obj {
        int *refCount* ;
        char **bytes* ;
        int *length* ;
        const [Tcl_ObjType](../TclLib/ObjectType.md) **typePtr* ;
        union {
            long *longValue* ;
            double *doubleValue* ;
            void **otherValuePtr* ;
            [Tcl_WideInt](../TclLib/IntObj.md) *wideValue* ;
            struct {
                void **ptr1* ;
                void **ptr2* ;
            } *twoPtrValue* ;
            struct {
                void **ptr* ;
                unsigned long *value* ;
            } *ptrAndLongRep* ;
        } *internalRep* ;
    } **Tcl_Obj** ;

The *bytes* and the *length* members together hold a value's UTF-8 string
representation, which is a *counted string* not containing null bytes (UTF-8
null characters should be encoded as a two byte sequence: 192, 128.) *bytes*
points to the first byte of the string representation. The *length* member
gives the number of bytes. The byte array must always have a null byte after
the last data byte, at offset *length* ; this allows string representations to
be treated as conventional null-terminated C strings. C programs use
**[Tcl_GetStringFromObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** and
**[Tcl_GetString](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** to get a value's string
representation. If *bytes* is NULL, the string representation is invalid.

A value's type manages its internal representation. The member *typePtr* points
to the [Tcl_ObjType](../TclLib/ObjectType.md) structure that describes the
type. If *typePtr* is NULL, the internal representation is invalid.

The *internalRep* union member holds a value's internal representation. This is
either a (long) integer, a double-precision floating-point number, a pointer to
a value containing additional information needed by the value's type to
represent the value, a [Tcl_WideInt](../TclLib/IntObj.md) integer, two
arbitrary pointers, or a pair made up of an unsigned long integer and a
pointer.

The *refCount* member is used to tell when it is safe to free a value's
storage. It holds the count of active references to the value. Maintaining the
correct reference count is a key responsibility of extension writers. Reference
counting is discussed below in the section **STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF VALUES**.

Although extension writers can directly access the members of a Tcl_Obj
structure, it is much better to use the appropriate procedures and macros. For
example, extension writers should never read or update *refCount* directly;
they should use macros such as **Tcl_IncrRefCount** and **Tcl_IsShared**
instead.

A key property of Tcl values is that they hold two representations. A value
typically starts out containing only a string representation: it is untyped and
has a NULL *typePtr*. A value containing an empty string or a copy of a
specified string is created using **Tcl_NewObj** or
**[Tcl_NewStringObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** respectively. A value's string
value is gotten with **[Tcl_GetStringFromObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** or
**[Tcl_GetString](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** and changed with
**[Tcl_SetStringObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)**. If the value is later passed
to a procedure like **[Tcl_GetIntFromObj](../TclLib/IntObj.md)** that requires
a specific internal representation, the procedure will create one and set the
value's *typePtr*. The internal representation is computed from the string
representation. A value's two representations are duals of each other: changes
made to one are reflected in the other. For example,
**[Tcl_ListObjReplace](../TclLib/ListObj.md)** will modify a value's internal
representation and the next call to
**[Tcl_GetStringFromObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** or
**[Tcl_GetString](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** will reflect that change.

Representations are recomputed lazily for efficiency. A change to one
representation made by a procedure such as
**[Tcl_ListObjReplace](../TclLib/ListObj.md)** is not reflected immediately in
the other representation. Instead, the other representation is marked invalid
so that it is only regenerated if it is needed later. Most C programmers never
have to be concerned with how this is done and simply use procedures such as
**[Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj](../TclLib/BoolObj.md)** or
**[Tcl_ListObjIndex](../TclLib/ListObj.md)**. Programmers that implement their
own value types must check for invalid representations and mark representations
invalid when necessary. The procedure **Tcl_InvalidateStringRep** is used to
mark a value's string representation invalid and to free any storage associated
with the old string representation.

Values usually remain one type over their life, but occasionally a value must
be converted from one type to another. For example, a C program might build up
a string in a value with repeated calls to
**[Tcl_AppendToObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** , and then call
**[Tcl_ListObjIndex](../TclLib/ListObj.md)** to extract a list element from
the value. The same value holding the same string value can have several
different internal representations at different times. Extension writers can
also force a value to be converted from one type to another using the
**[Tcl_ConvertToType](../TclLib/ObjectType.md)** procedure. Only programmers
that create new value types need to be concerned about how this is done. A
procedure defined as part of the value type's implementation creates a new
internal representation for a value and changes its *typePtr*. See the man page
for **[Tcl_RegisterObjType](../TclLib/ObjectType.md)** to see how to create a
new value type.

### EXAMPLE OF THE LIFETIME OF A VALUE

As an example of the lifetime of a value, consider the following sequence of
commands:

    
    
    **set x 123**

This assigns to *x* an untyped value whose *bytes* member points to **123** and
*length* member contains 3. The value's *typePtr* member is NULL.

    
    
    **puts "x is $x"**

*x* 's string representation is valid (since *bytes* is non-NULL) and is fetched for the command. 
    
    
    **incr x**

The **[incr](../TclCmd/incr.md)** command first gets an integer from *x* 's
value by calling **[Tcl_GetIntFromObj](../TclLib/IntObj.md)**. This procedure
checks whether the value is already an integer value. Since it is not, it
converts the value by setting the value's internal representation to the
integer **123** and setting the value's *typePtr* to point to the integer
[Tcl_ObjType](../TclLib/ObjectType.md) structure. Both representations are now
valid. **[incr](../TclCmd/incr.md)** increments the value's integer internal
representation then invalidates its string representation (by calling
**Tcl_InvalidateStringRep**) since the string representation no longer
corresponds to the internal representation.

    
    
    **puts "x is now $x"**

The string representation of *x* 's value is needed and is recomputed. The
string representation is now **124** and both representations are again valid.

### STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF VALUES

Tcl values are allocated on the heap and are shared as much as possible to
reduce storage requirements. Reference counting is used to determine when a
value is no longer needed and can safely be freed. A value just created by
**Tcl_NewObj** or **[Tcl_NewStringObj](../TclLib/StringObj.md)** has
*refCount* 0\. The macro **Tcl_IncrRefCount** increments the reference count
when a new reference to the value is created. The macro **Tcl_DecrRefCount**
decrements the count when a reference is no longer needed and, if the value's
reference count drops to zero, frees its storage. A value shared by different
code or data structures has *refCount* greater than 1. Incrementing a value's
reference count ensures that it will not be freed too early or have its value
change accidentally.

As an example, the bytecode interpreter shares argument values between calling
and called Tcl procedures to avoid having to copy values. It assigns the call's
argument values to the procedure's formal parameter variables. In doing so, it
calls **Tcl_IncrRefCount** to increment the reference count of each argument
since there is now a new reference to it from the formal parameter. When the
called procedure returns, the interpreter calls **Tcl_DecrRefCount** to
decrement each argument's reference count. When a value's reference count drops
less than or equal to zero, **Tcl_DecrRefCount** reclaims its storage. Most
command procedures do not have to be concerned about reference counting since
they use a value's value immediately and do not retain a pointer to the value
after they return. However, if they do retain a pointer to a value in a data
structure, they must be careful to increment its reference count since the
retained pointer is a new reference.

Command procedures that directly modify values such as those for
**[lappend](../TclCmd/lappend.md)** and **[linsert](../TclCmd/linsert.md)**
must be careful to copy a shared value before changing it. They must first
check whether the value is shared by calling **Tcl_IsShared**. If the value is
shared they must copy the value by using **Tcl_DuplicateObj** ; this returns a
new duplicate of the original value that has *refCount* 0\. If the value is not
shared, the command procedure “owns” the value and can safely modify it
directly. For example, the following code appears in the command procedure that
implements **[linsert](../TclCmd/linsert.md)**. This procedure modifies the
list value passed to it in *objv[1]* by inserting *objc-3* new elements before
*index*.

    
    
    listPtr = objv[1];
    if (**Tcl_IsShared**(listPtr)) {
        listPtr = **Tcl_DuplicateObj**(listPtr);
    }
    result = [Tcl_ListObjReplace](../TclLib/ListObj.md)(interp, listPtr, index, 0,
            (objc-3), &(objv[3]));

As another example, **[incr](../TclCmd/incr.md)** 's command procedure must
check whether the variable's value is shared before incrementing the integer in
its internal representation. If it is shared, it needs to duplicate the value
in order to avoid accidentally changing values in other data structures.
