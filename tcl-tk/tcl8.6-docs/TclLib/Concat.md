### NAME

Tcl_Concat — concatenate a collection of strings

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
const char *  
**Tcl_Concat**(*argc, argv*)  

### ARGUMENTS

int **[argc](../TclCmd/tclvars.md)** (in)     Number of strings.

const char *const **argv[]** (in)     Array of strings to concatenate. Must
have *argc* entries.

### DESCRIPTION

**Tcl_Concat** is a utility procedure used by several of the Tcl commands.
Given a collection of strings, it concatenates them together into a single
string, with the original strings separated by spaces. This procedure behaves
differently than **[Tcl_Merge](../TclLib/SplitList.md)** , in that the
arguments are simply concatenated: no effort is made to ensure proper list
structure. However, in most common usage the arguments will all be proper lists
themselves; if this is true, then the result will also have proper list
structure.

**Tcl_Concat** eliminates leading and trailing white space as it copies strings
from **[argv](../TclCmd/tclvars.md)** to the result. If an element of
**[argv](../TclCmd/tclvars.md)** consists of nothing but white space, then
that string is ignored entirely. This white-space removal was added to make the
output of the **[concat](../TclCmd/concat.md)** command cleaner-looking.

The result string is dynamically allocated using
**[Tcl_Alloc](../TclLib/Alloc.md)** ; the caller must eventually release the
space by calling **[Tcl_Free](../TclLib/Alloc.md)**.
