### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in/out)     Interpreter
providing the context for looking up or creating an object, and into whose
result error messages will be written on failure.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ***objPtr** (in)     The name of the object to
look up.

Tcl_Object **object** (in)     Reference to the object to operate upon.

Tcl_Class **class** (in)     Reference to the class to operate upon.

const char ***name** (in)     The name of the object to create, or NULL if a
new unused name is to be automatically selected.

const char ***nsName** (in)     The name of the namespace to create for the
object's private use, or NULL if a new unused name is to be automatically
selected. The namespace must not already exist.

int **objc** (in)     The number of elements in the *objv* array.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) *const ***objv** (in)     The arguments to the
command to create the instance of the class.

int **skip** (in)     The number of arguments at the start of the argument
array, *objv* , that are not arguments to any constructors. This allows the
generation of correct error messages even when complicated calling patterns are
used (e.g., via the **[next](../TclCmd/next.md)** command).

Tcl_ObjectMetadataType ***metaTypePtr** (in)     The type of *metadata* being
set with **Tcl_ClassSetMetadata** or retrieved with **Tcl_ClassGetMetadata**.

ClientData **metadata** (in)     An item of metadata to attach to the class, or
NULL to remove the metadata associated with a particular *metaTypePtr*.

Tcl_ObjectMapMethodNameProc **methodNameMapper** (in)     A pointer to a
function to call to adjust the mapping of objects and method names to
implementations, or NULL when no such mapping is required.

### DESCRIPTION

Objects are typed entities that have a set of operations ("methods") associated
with them. Classes are objects that can manufacture objects. Each class can be
viewed as an object itself; the object view can be retrieved using
**Tcl_GetClassAsObject** which always returns the object when applied to a non-
destroyed class, and an object can be viewed as a class with the aid of the
**Tcl_GetObjectAsClass** (which either returns the class, or NULL if the object
is not a class). An object may be looked up using the **Tcl_GetObjectFromObj**
function, which either returns an object or NULL (with an error message in the
interpreter result) if the object cannot be found. The correct way to look up a
class by name is to look up the object with that name, and then to use
**Tcl_GetObjectAsClass**.

Every object has its own command and namespace associated with it. The command
may be retrieved using the **Tcl_GetObjectCommand** function, the name of the
object (and hence the name of the command) with **Tcl_GetObjectName** , and the
namespace may be retrieved using the **Tcl_GetObjectNamespace** function. Note
that the [Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) reference returned by
**Tcl_GetObjectName** is a shared reference. You can also get whether the
object has been marked for deletion with **Tcl_ObjectDeleted** (it returns true
if deletion of the object has begun); this can be useful during the processing
of methods.

Instances of classes are created using **Tcl_NewObjectInstance** , which
creates an object from any class (and which is internally called by both the
**create** and **new** methods of the **[oo::class](../TclCmd/class.md)**
class). It takes parameters that optionally give the name of the object and
namespace to create, and which describe the arguments to pass to the class's
constructor (if any). The result of the function will be either a reference to
the newly created object, or NULL if the creation failed (when an error message
will be left in the interpreter result). In addition, objects may be copied by
using **Tcl_CopyObjectInstance** which creates a copy of an object without
running any constructors.

Note that the lifetime management of objects is handled internally within
TclOO, and does not use **[Tcl_Preserve](../TclLib/Preserve.md)**. *It is not
safe to put a Tcl_Object handle in a C structure with a lifespan different to
the object;* you should use the object's command name (as retrieved with
**Tcl_GetObjectName**) instead. It is safe to use a Tcl_Object handle for the
lifespan of a call of a method on that object; handles do not become invalid
while there is an outstanding call on their object (even if the only operation
guaranteed to be safe on them is **Tcl_ObjectDeleted** ; the other operations
are only guaranteed to work on non-deleted objects).

### OBJECT AND CLASS METADATA

Every object and every class may have arbitrary amounts of metadata attached to
it, which the object or class attaches no meaning to beyond what is described
in a Tcl_ObjectMetadataType structure instance. Metadata to be attached is
described by the type of the metadata (given in the *metaTypePtr* argument) and
an arbitrary pointer (the *metadata* argument) that are given to
**Tcl_ObjectSetMetadata** and **Tcl_ClassSetMetadata** , and a particular piece
of metadata can be retrieved given its type using **Tcl_ObjectGetMetadata** and
**Tcl_ClassGetMetadata**. If the *metadata* parameter to either
**Tcl_ObjectSetMetadata** or **Tcl_ClassSetMetadata** is NULL, the metadata is
removed if it was attached, and the results of **Tcl_ObjectGetMetadata** and
**Tcl_ClassGetMetadata** are NULL if the given type of metadata was not
attached. It is not an error to request or remove a piece of metadata that was
not attached.

#### TCL_OBJECTMETADATATYPE STRUCTURE

The contents of the Tcl_ObjectMetadataType structure are as follows:

    
    
    typedef const struct {
        int *version* ;
        const char **name* ;
        Tcl_ObjectMetadataDeleteProc **deleteProc* ;
        Tcl_CloneProc **cloneProc* ;
    } **Tcl_ObjectMetadataType** ;

The *version* field allows for future expansion of the structure, and should
always be declared equal to TCL_OO_METADATA_VERSION_CURRENT. The *name* field
provides a human-readable name for the type, and is reserved for debugging.

The *deleteProc* field gives a function of type Tcl_ObjectMetadataDeleteProc
that is used to delete a particular piece of metadata, and is called when the
attached metadata is replaced or removed; the field must not be NULL.

The *cloneProc* field gives a function that is used to copy a piece of metadata
(used when a copy of an object is created using **Tcl_CopyObjectInstance**); if
NULL, the metadata will be just directly copied.

#### TCL_OBJECTMETADATADELETEPROC FUNCTION SIGNATURE

Functions matching this signature are used to delete metadata associated with a
class or object.

    
    
    typedef void **Tcl_ObjectMetadataDeleteProc**(
            ClientData *metadata*);

The *metadata* argument gives the address of the metadata to be deleted.

#### TCL_CLONEPROC FUNCTION SIGNATURE

Functions matching this signature are used to create copies of metadata
associated with a class or object.

    
    
    typedef int **Tcl_CloneProc**(
            [Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) **interp* ,
            ClientData *srcMetadata* ,
            ClientData **dstMetadataPtr*);

The *interp* argument gives a place to write an error message when the attempt
to clone the object is to fail, in which case the clone procedure must also
return TCL_ERROR; it should return TCL_OK otherwise. The *srcMetadata* argument
gives the address of the metadata to be cloned, and the cloned metadata should
be written into the variable pointed to by *dstMetadataPtr* ; a NULL should be
written if the metadata is to not be cloned but the overall object copy
operation is still to succeed.

### OBJECT METHOD NAME MAPPING

It is possible to control, on a per-object basis, what methods are invoked when
a particular method is invoked. Normally this is done by looking up the method
name in the object and then in the class hierarchy, but fine control of exactly
what the value used to perform the look up is afforded through the ability to
set a method name mapper callback via **Tcl_ObjectSetMethodNameMapper** (and
its introspection counterpart, **Tcl_ObjectGetMethodNameMapper** , which
returns the current mapper). The current mapper (if any) is invoked immediately
before looking up what chain of method implementations is to be used.

#### TCL_OBJECTMAPMETHODNAMEPROC FUNCTION SIGNATURE

The *Tcl_ObjectMapMethodNameProc* callback is defined as follows:

    
    
    typedef int **Tcl_ObjectMapMethodNameProc**(
            [Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) **interp* ,
            Tcl_Object *object* ,
            Tcl_Class **startClsPtr* ,
            [Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) **methodNameObj*);

If the result is TCL_OK, the remapping is assumed to have been done. If the
result is TCL_ERROR, an error message will have been left in *interp* and the
method call will fail. If the result is TCL_BREAK, the standard method name
lookup rules will be used; the behavior of other result codes is currently
undefined. The *object* parameter says which object is being processed. The
*startClsPtr* parameter points to a variable that contains the first class to
provide a definition in the method chain to process, or NULL if the whole chain
is to be processed (the argument itself is never NULL); this variable may be
updated by the callback. The *methodNameObj* parameter gives an unshared object
containing the name of the method being invoked, as provided by the user; this
object may be updated by the callback.
