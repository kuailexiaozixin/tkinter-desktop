### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter in which to
execute the script. The interpreter's result is modified to hold the result or
error message from the script.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ***objPtr** (in)     A Tcl value containing the
script to execute.

int **flags** (in)     OR'ed combination of flag bits that specify additional
options. **TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL** and **TCL_EVAL_DIRECT** are currently supported.

const char ***fileName** (in)     Name of a file containing a Tcl script.

int **objc** (in)     The number of values in the array pointed to by *objv* ;
this is also the number of words in the command.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ****objv** (in)     Points to an array of
pointers to values; each value holds the value of a single word in the command
to execute.

int **numBytes** (in)     The number of bytes in *script* , not including any
null terminating character. If -1, then all characters up to the first null
byte are used.

const char ***script** (in)     Points to first byte of script to execute
(null-terminated and UTF-8).

const char ***part** (in)     String forming part of a Tcl script.

va_list **argList** (in)     An argument list which must have been initialized
using **va_start** , and cleared using **va_end**.

### DESCRIPTION

The procedures described here are invoked to execute Tcl scripts in various
forms. **Tcl_EvalObjEx** is the core procedure and is used by many of the
others. It executes the commands in the script stored in *objPtr* until either
an error occurs or the end of the script is reached. If this is the first time
*objPtr* has been executed, its commands are compiled into bytecode
instructions which are then executed. The bytecodes are saved in *objPtr* so
that the compilation step can be skipped if the value is evaluated again in the
future.

The return value from **Tcl_EvalObjEx** (and all the other procedures described
here) is a Tcl completion code with one of the values
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** ,
**[TCL_RETURN](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , **[TCL_BREAK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** ,
or **[TCL_CONTINUE](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , or possibly some other integer
value originating in an extension. In addition, a result value or error message
is left in *interp* 's result; it can be retrieved using
**[Tcl_GetObjResult](../TclLib/SetResult.md)**.

**Tcl_EvalFile** reads the file given by *fileName* and evaluates its contents
as a Tcl script. It returns the same information as **Tcl_EvalObjEx**. If the
file could not be read then a Tcl error is returned to describe why the file
could not be read. The eofchar for files is “\32” (^Z) for all platforms. If
you require a “^Z” in code for string comparison, you can use “\032” or
“\u001a”, which will be safely substituted by the Tcl interpreter into “^Z”.

**Tcl_EvalObjv** executes a single preparsed command instead of a script. The
*objc* and *objv* arguments contain the values of the words for the Tcl
command, one word in each value in *objv*. **Tcl_EvalObjv** evaluates the
command and returns a completion code and result just like **Tcl_EvalObjEx**.
The caller of **Tcl_EvalObjv** has to manage the reference count of the
elements of *objv* , insuring that the values are valid until **Tcl_EvalObjv**
returns.

**Tcl_Eval** is similar to **Tcl_EvalObjEx** except that the script to be
executed is supplied as a string instead of a value and no compilation occurs.
The string should be a proper UTF-8 string as converted by
**[Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString](../TclLib/Encoding.md)** or
**[Tcl_ExternalToUtf](../TclLib/Encoding.md)** when it is known to possibly
contain upper ASCII characters whose possible combinations might be a UTF-8
special code. The string is parsed and executed directly (using
**Tcl_EvalObjv**) instead of compiling it and executing the bytecodes. In
situations where it is known that the script will never be executed again,
**Tcl_Eval** may be faster than **Tcl_EvalObjEx**. **Tcl_Eval** returns a
completion code and result just like **Tcl_EvalObjEx**. Note: for backward
compatibility with versions before Tcl 8.0, **Tcl_Eval** copies the value
result in *interp* to *interp- >result* (use is deprecated) where it can be
accessed directly. This makes **Tcl_Eval** somewhat slower than **Tcl_EvalEx**
, which does not do the copy.

**Tcl_EvalEx** is an extended version of **Tcl_Eval** that takes additional
arguments *numBytes* and *flags*. For the efficiency reason given above,
**Tcl_EvalEx** is generally preferred over **Tcl_Eval**.

**Tcl_GlobalEval** and **Tcl_GlobalEvalObj** are older procedures that are now
deprecated. They are similar to **Tcl_EvalEx** and **Tcl_EvalObjEx** except
that the script is evaluated in the global namespace and its variable context
consists of global variables only (it ignores any Tcl procedures that are
active). These functions are equivalent to using the **TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL** flag
(see below).

**Tcl_VarEval** takes any number of string arguments of any length,
concatenates them into a single string, then calls **Tcl_Eval** to execute that
string as a Tcl command. It returns the result of the command and also modifies
*interp- >result* in the same way as **Tcl_Eval**. The last argument to
**Tcl_VarEval** must be (char *)NULL to indicate the end of arguments.

**Tcl_VarEvalVA** is the same as **Tcl_VarEval** except that instead of taking
a variable number of arguments it takes an argument list. **Tcl_VarEvalVA** is
now deprecated.

### FLAG BITS

Any OR'ed combination of the following values may be used for the *flags*
argument to procedures such as **Tcl_EvalObjEx** :

**TCL_EVAL_DIRECT**     This flag is only used by **Tcl_EvalObjEx** ; it is
ignored by other procedures. If this flag bit is set, the script is not
compiled to bytecodes; instead it is executed directly as is done by
**Tcl_EvalEx**. The **TCL_EVAL_DIRECT** flag is useful in situations where the
contents of a value are going to change immediately, so the bytecodes will not
be reused in a future execution. In this case, it is faster to execute the
script directly.

**TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL**     If this flag is set, the script is evaluated in the
global namespace instead of the current namespace and its variable context
consists of global variables only (it ignores any Tcl procedures that are
active).

### MISCELLANEOUS DETAILS

During the processing of a Tcl command it is legal to make nested calls to
evaluate other commands (this is how procedures and some control structures are
implemented). If a code other than **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is
returned from a nested **Tcl_EvalObjEx** invocation, then the caller should
normally return immediately, passing that same return code back to its caller,
and so on until the top-level application is reached. A few commands, like
**[for](../TclCmd/for.md)** , will check for certain return codes, like
**[TCL_BREAK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and
**[TCL_CONTINUE](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , and process them specially without
returning.

**Tcl_EvalObjEx** keeps track of how many nested **Tcl_EvalObjEx** invocations
are in progress for *interp*. If a code of
**[TCL_RETURN](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , **[TCL_BREAK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** ,
or **[TCL_CONTINUE](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is about to be returned from the
topmost **Tcl_EvalObjEx** invocation for *interp* , it converts the return code
to **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and sets *interp* 's result to an error
message indicating that the **[return](../TclCmd/return.md)** ,
**[break](../TclCmd/break.md)** , or **[continue](../TclCmd/continue.md)**
command was invoked in an inappropriate place. This means that top-level
applications should never see a return code from **Tcl_EvalObjEx** other than
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** or **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)**.
