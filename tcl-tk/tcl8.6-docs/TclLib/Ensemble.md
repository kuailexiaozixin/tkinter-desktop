### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in/out)     The interpreter in
which the ensemble is to be created or found. Also where error result messages
are written. The functions whose names start with **Tcl_GetEnsemble** may have
a NULL for the *interp* , but all other functions must not.

const char ***name** (in)     The name of the ensemble command to be created.

[Tcl_Namespace](../TclLib/Namespace.md) ***namespacePtr** (in)     The
namespace to which the ensemble command is to be bound, or NULL for the current
namespace.

int **ensFlags** (in)     An OR'ed set of flag bits describing the basic
configuration of the ensemble. Currently only one bit has meaning,
**TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX** , which is present when the ensemble command should
also match unambiguous prefixes of subcommands.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ***cmdNameObj** (in)     A value holding the
name of the ensemble command to look up.

int **flags** (in)     An OR'ed set of flag bits controlling the behavior of
**Tcl_FindEnsemble**. Currently only **TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG** is supported.

[Tcl_Command](../TclLib/CrtObjCmd.md) **token** (in)     A normal command
token that refers to an ensemble command, or which you wish to use for testing
as an ensemble command in **Tcl_IsEnsemble**.

int ***ensFlagsPtr** (out)     Pointer to a variable into which to write the
current ensemble flag bits; currently only the bit **TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX** is
defined.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ***dictObj** (in)     A dictionary value to use
for the subcommand to implementation command prefix mapping dictionary in the
ensemble. May be NULL if the mapping dictionary is to be removed.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ****dictObjPtr** (out)     Pointer to a
variable into which to write the current ensemble mapping dictionary.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ***listObj** (in)     A list value to use for
the list of formal pre-subcommand parameters, the defined list of subcommands
in the dictionary or the unknown subcommand handler command prefix. May be NULL
if the subcommand list or unknown handler are to be removed.

[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) ****listObjPtr** (out)     Pointer to a
variable into which to write the current list of formal pre-subcommand
parameters, the defined list of subcommands or the current unknown handler
prefix.

[Tcl_Namespace](../TclLib/Namespace.md) ****namespacePtrPtr** (out)
Pointer to a variable into which to write the handle of the namespace to which
the ensemble is bound.

### DESCRIPTION

An ensemble is a command, bound to some namespace, which consists of a
collection of subcommands implemented by other Tcl commands. The first argument
to the ensemble command is always interpreted as a selector that states what
subcommand to execute.

Ensembles are created using **Tcl_CreateEnsemble** , which takes four
arguments: the interpreter to work within, the name of the ensemble to create,
the namespace within the interpreter to bind the ensemble to, and the default
set of ensemble flags. The result of the function is the command token for the
ensemble, which may be used to further configure the ensemble using the API
described below in **ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES**.

Given the name of an ensemble command, the token for that command may be
retrieved using **Tcl_FindEnsemble**. If the given command name (in
*cmdNameObj*) does not refer to an ensemble command, the result of the function
is NULL and (if the **TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG** bit is set in *flags*) an error
message is left in the interpreter result.

A command token may be checked to see if it refers to an ensemble using
**Tcl_IsEnsemble**. This returns 1 if the token refers to an ensemble, or 0
otherwise.

#### ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES

Every ensemble has four read-write properties and a read-only property. The
properties are:

**flags** (read-write)     The set of flags for the ensemble, expressed as a
bit-field. Currently, the only public flag is **TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX** which is
set when unambiguous prefixes of subcommands are permitted to be resolved to
implementations as well as exact matches. The flags may be read and written
using **Tcl_GetEnsembleFlags** and **Tcl_SetEnsembleFlags** respectively. The
result of both of those functions is a Tcl result code
(**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , or **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if
the token does not refer to an ensemble).

**mapping dictionary** (read-write)     A dictionary containing a mapping from
subcommand names to lists of words to use as a command prefix (replacing the
first two words of the command which are the ensemble command itself and the
subcommand name), or NULL if every subcommand is to be mapped to the command
with the same unqualified name in the ensemble's bound namespace. Defaults to
NULL. May be read and written using **Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict** and
**Tcl_SetEnsembleMappingDict** respectively. The result of both of those
functions is a Tcl result code (**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , or
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if the token does not refer to an
ensemble) and the dictionary obtained from **Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict**
should always be treated as immutable even if it is unshared. All command names
in prefixes set via **Tcl_SetEnsembleMappingDict** must be fully qualified.

**formal pre-subcommand parameter list** (read-write)     A list of formal
parameter names (the names only being used when generating error messages) that
come at invocation of the ensemble between the name of the ensemble and the
subcommand argument. NULL (the default) is equivalent to the empty list. May be
read and written using **Tcl_GetEnsembleParameterList** and
**Tcl_SetEnsembleParameterList** respectively. The result of both of those
functions is a Tcl result code (**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , or
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if the token does not refer to an
ensemble) and the dictionary obtained from **Tcl_GetEnsembleParameterList**
should always be treated as immutable even if it is unshared.

**subcommand list** (read-write)     A list of all the subcommand names for the
ensemble, or NULL if this is to be derived from either the keys of the mapping
dictionary (see above) or (if that is also NULL) from the set of commands
exported by the bound namespace. May be read and written using
**Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList** and **Tcl_SetEnsembleSubcommandList**
respectively. The result of both of those functions is a Tcl result code
(**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , or **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if
the token does not refer to an ensemble) and the list obtained from
**Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList** should always be treated as immutable even if
it is unshared.

**unknown subcommand handler command prefix** (read-write)     A list of words
to prepend on the front of any subcommand when the subcommand is unknown to the
ensemble (according to the current prefix handling rule); see the **[namespace
ensemble](../TclCmd/namespace.md)** command for more details. If NULL, the
default behavior - generate a suitable error message - will be used when an
unknown subcommand is encountered. May be read and written using
**Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler** and **Tcl_SetEnsembleUnknownHandler**
respectively. The result of both functions is a Tcl result code
(**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , or **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if
the token does not refer to an ensemble) and the list obtained from
**Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler** should always be treated as immutable even if
it is unshared.

**bound namespace** (read-only)     The namespace to which the ensemble is
bound; when the namespace is deleted, so too will the ensemble, and this
namespace is also the namespace whose list of exported commands is used if both
the mapping dictionary and the subcommand list properties are NULL. May be read
using **Tcl_GetEnsembleNamespace** which returns a Tcl result code
(**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** , or **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if
the token does not refer to an ensemble).
