### NAME

Tcl_DumpActiveMemory, Tcl_InitMemory, Tcl_ValidateAllMemory — Validated memory
allocation interface

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
int  
**Tcl_DumpActiveMemory**(*fileName*)  
void  
**Tcl_InitMemory**(*interp*)  
void  
**Tcl_ValidateAllMemory**(*fileName, line*)  
  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Tcl interpreter in
which to add commands.

const char ***fileName** (in)     For **Tcl_DumpActiveMemory** , name of the
file to which memory information will be written. For **Tcl_ValidateAllMemory**
, name of the file from which the call is being made (normally **__FILE__**).

int **line** (in)     Line number at which the call to
**Tcl_ValidateAllMemory** is made (normally **__LINE__**).

### DESCRIPTION

These functions provide access to Tcl memory debugging information. They are
only functional when Tcl has been compiled with **TCL_MEM_DEBUG** defined at
compile-time. When **TCL_MEM_DEBUG** is not defined, these functions are all
no-ops.

**Tcl_DumpActiveMemory** will output a list of all currently allocated memory
to the specified file. The information output for each allocated block of
memory is: starting and ending addresses (excluding guard zone), size, source
file where **[ckalloc](../TclLib/Alloc.md)** was called to allocate the block
and line number in that file. It is especially useful to call
**Tcl_DumpActiveMemory** after the Tcl interpreter has been deleted.

**Tcl_InitMemory** adds the Tcl **[memory](../TclCmd/memory.md)** command to
the interpreter given by *interp*. **Tcl_InitMemory** is called by
**[Tcl_Main](../TclLib/Tcl_Main.md)**.

**Tcl_ValidateAllMemory** forces a validation of the guard zones of all
currently allocated blocks of memory. Normally validation of a block occurs
when its freed, unless full validation is enabled, in which case validation of
all blocks occurs when **[ckalloc](../TclLib/Alloc.md)** and
**[ckfree](../TclLib/Alloc.md)** are called. This function forces the
validation to occur at any point.
