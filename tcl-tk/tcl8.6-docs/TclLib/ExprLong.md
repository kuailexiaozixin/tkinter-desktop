### NAME

Tcl_ExprLong, Tcl_ExprDouble, Tcl_ExprBoolean, Tcl_ExprString — evaluate an
expression

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
int  
**Tcl_ExprLong**(*interp, expr, longPtr*)  
int  
**Tcl_ExprDouble**(*interp, expr, doublePtr*)  
int  
**Tcl_ExprBoolean**(*interp, expr, booleanPtr*)  
int  
**Tcl_ExprString**(*interp, expr*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter in whose
context to evaluate *expr*.

const char ***expr** (in)     Expression to be evaluated.

long ***longPtr** (out)     Pointer to location in which to store the integer
value of the expression.

int ***doublePtr** (out)     Pointer to location in which to store the
floating-point value of the expression.

int ***booleanPtr** (out)     Pointer to location in which to store the 0/1
boolean value of the expression.

### DESCRIPTION

These four procedures all evaluate the expression given by the *expr* argument
and return the result in one of four different forms. The expression can have
any of the forms accepted by the **[expr](../TclCmd/expr.md)** command. Note
that these procedures have been largely replaced by the value-based procedures
**[Tcl_ExprLongObj](../TclLib/ExprLongObj.md)** ,
**[Tcl_ExprDoubleObj](../TclLib/ExprLongObj.md)** ,
**[Tcl_ExprBooleanObj](../TclLib/ExprLongObj.md)** , and
**[Tcl_ExprObj](../TclLib/ExprLongObj.md)**. Those value-based procedures
evaluate an expression held in a Tcl value instead of a string. The value
argument can retain an internal representation that is more efficient to
execute.

The *interp* argument refers to an interpreter used to evaluate the expression
(e.g. for variables and nested Tcl commands) and to return error information.

For all of these procedures the return value is a standard Tcl result:
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** means the expression was successfully
evaluated, and **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** means that an error
occurred while evaluating the expression. If
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned then the interpreter's result
will hold a message describing the error. If an error occurs while executing a
Tcl command embedded in the expression then that error will be returned.

If the expression is successfully evaluated, then its value is returned in one
of four forms, depending on which procedure is invoked. **Tcl_ExprLong** stores
an integer value at **longPtr*. If the expression's actual value is a floating-
point number, then it is truncated to an integer. If the expression's actual
value is a non-numeric string then an error is returned.

**Tcl_ExprDouble** stores a floating-point value at **doublePtr*. If the
expression's actual value is an integer, it is converted to floating-point. If
the expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then an error is
returned.

**Tcl_ExprBoolean** stores a 0/1 integer value at **booleanPtr*. If the
expression's actual value is an integer or floating-point number, then they
store 0 at **booleanPtr* if the value was zero and 1 otherwise. If the
expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then it must be one of the
values accepted by **[Tcl_GetBoolean](../TclLib/GetInt.md)** such as “yes” or
“no”, or else an error occurs.

**Tcl_ExprString** returns the value of the expression as a string stored in
the interpreter's result.
