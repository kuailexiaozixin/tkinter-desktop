### NAME

Tcl_GetVersion — get the version of the library at runtime

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
**Tcl_GetVersion**(*major, minor, patchLevel, type*)  

### ARGUMENTS

int ***major** (out)     Major version number of the Tcl library.

int ***minor** (out)     Minor version number of the Tcl library.

int ***patchLevel** (out)     The patch level of the Tcl library (or alpha or
beta number).

Tcl_ReleaseType ***type** (out)     The type of release, also indicates the
type of patch level. Can be one of **TCL_ALPHA_RELEASE** , **TCL_BETA_RELEASE**
, or **TCL_FINAL_RELEASE**.

### DESCRIPTION

**Tcl_GetVersion** should be used to query the version number of the Tcl
library at runtime. This is useful when using a dynamically loaded Tcl library
or when writing a stubs-aware extension. For instance, if you write an
extension that is linked against the Tcl stubs library, it could be loaded into
a program linked to an older version of Tcl than you expected. Use
**Tcl_GetVersion** to verify that fact, and possibly to change the behavior of
your extension.

**Tcl_GetVersion** accepts NULL for any of the arguments. For instance if you
do not care about the *patchLevel* of the library, pass a NULL for the
*patchLevel* argument.
