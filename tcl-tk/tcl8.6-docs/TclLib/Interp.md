### NAME

Tcl_Interp — client-visible fields of interpreter structures

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
typedef struct {  
`    `char **result* ;  
`    `Tcl_FreeProc **freeProc* ;  
`    `int *errorLine* ;  
} **Tcl_Interp** ;  
  
typedef void **Tcl_FreeProc**(  
`        `char **blockPtr*);  

### DESCRIPTION

The **[Tcl_CreateInterp](../TclLib/CrtInterp.md)** procedure returns a pointer
to a Tcl_Interp structure. Callers of
**[Tcl_CreateInterp](../TclLib/CrtInterp.md)** should use this pointer as an
opaque token, suitable for nothing other than passing back to other routines in
the Tcl interface. Accessing fields directly through the pointer as described
below is no longer supported. The supported public routines
**[Tcl_SetResult](../TclLib/SetResult.md)** , **Tcl_GetResult** ,
**[Tcl_SetErrorLine](../TclLib/AddErrInfo.md)** ,
**[Tcl_GetErrorLine](../TclLib/AddErrInfo.md)** must be used instead.

For legacy programs and extensions no longer being maintained, compiles against
the Tcl 8.6 header files are only possible with the compiler directives

    
    
    #define USE_INTERP_RESULT

and/or

    
    
    #define USE_INTERP_ERRORLINE

depending on which fields of the **Tcl_Interp** struct are accessed. These
directives may be embedded in code or supplied via compiler options.

The *result* and *freeProc* fields are used to return results or error messages
from commands. This information is returned by command procedures back to
**[Tcl_Eval](../TclLib/Eval.md)** , and by **[Tcl_Eval](../TclLib/Eval.md)**
back to its callers. The *result* field points to the string that represents
the result or error message, and the *freeProc* field tells how to dispose of
the storage for the string when it is not needed anymore. The easiest way for
command procedures to manipulate these fields is to call procedures like
**[Tcl_SetResult](../TclLib/SetResult.md)** or
**[Tcl_AppendResult](../TclLib/SetResult.md)** ; they will hide all the
details of managing the fields. The description below is for those procedures
that manipulate the fields directly.

Whenever a command procedure returns, it must ensure that the *result* field of
its interpreter points to the string being returned by the command. The
*result* field must always point to a valid string. If a command wishes to
return no result then *interp- >result* should point to an empty string.
Normally, results are assumed to be statically allocated, which means that the
contents will not change before the next time
**[Tcl_Eval](../TclLib/Eval.md)** is called or some other command procedure is
invoked. In this case, the *freeProc* field must be zero. Alternatively, a
command procedure may dynamically allocate its return value (e.g. using
**[Tcl_Alloc](../TclLib/Alloc.md)**) and store a pointer to it in *interp-
>result*. In this case, the command procedure must also set *interp- >freeProc*
to the address of a procedure that can free the value, or **TCL_DYNAMIC** if
the storage was allocated directly by Tcl or by a call to
**[Tcl_Alloc](../TclLib/Alloc.md)**. If *interp- >freeProc* is non-zero, then
Tcl will call *freeProc* to free the space pointed to by *interp- >result*
before it invokes the next command. If a client procedure overwrites *interp-
>result* when *interp- >freeProc* is non-zero, then it is responsible for
calling *freeProc* to free the old *interp- >result* (the
**[Tcl_FreeResult](../TclLib/SetResult.md)** macro should be used for this
purpose).

*FreeProc* should have arguments and result that match the **Tcl_FreeProc** declaration above: it receives a single argument which is a pointer to the result value to free. In most applications **TCL_DYNAMIC** is the only non-zero value ever used for *freeProc*. However, an application may store a different procedure address in *freeProc* in order to use an alternate memory allocator or in order to do other cleanup when the result memory is freed. 

As part of processing each command, **[Tcl_Eval](../TclLib/Eval.md)**
initializes *interp- >result* and *interp- >freeProc* just before calling the
command procedure for the command. The *freeProc* field will be initialized to
zero, and *interp- >result* will point to an empty string. Commands that do not
return any value can simply leave the fields alone. Furthermore, the empty
string pointed to by *result* is actually part of an array of
**TCL_RESULT_SIZE** characters (approximately 200). If a command wishes to
return a short string, it can simply copy it to the area pointed to by *interp-
>result*. Or, it can use the sprintf procedure to generate a short result
string at the location pointed to by *interp- >result*.

It is a general convention in Tcl-based applications that the result of an
interpreter is normally in the initialized state described in the previous
paragraph. Procedures that manipulate an interpreter's result (e.g. by
returning an error) will generally assume that the result has been initialized
when the procedure is called. If such a procedure is to be called after the
result has been changed, then **[Tcl_ResetResult](../TclLib/SetResult.md)**
should be called first to reset the result to its initialized state. The direct
use of *interp- >result* is strongly deprecated (see
**[Tcl_SetResult](../TclLib/SetResult.md)**).

The *errorLine* field is valid only after **[Tcl_Eval](../TclLib/Eval.md)**
returns a **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** return code. In this situation
the *errorLine* field identifies the line number of the command being executed
when the error occurred. The line numbers are relative to the command being
executed: 1 means the first line of the command passed to
**[Tcl_Eval](../TclLib/Eval.md)** , 2 means the second line, and so on. The
*errorLine* field is typically used in conjunction with
**[Tcl_AddErrorInfo](../TclLib/AddErrInfo.md)** to report information about
where an error occurred. *ErrorLine* should not normally be modified except by
**[Tcl_Eval](../TclLib/Eval.md)**.
