### NAME

Tcl_TranslateFileName — convert file name to native form and replace tilde with
home directory

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
char *  
**Tcl_TranslateFileName**(*interp* , *name* , *bufferPtr*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter in which to
report an error, if any.

const char ***name** (in)     File name, which may start with a “~”.

[Tcl_DString](../TclLib/DString.md) ***bufferPtr** (in/out)     If needed,
this dynamic string is used to store the new file name. At the time of the call
it should be uninitialized or free. The caller must eventually call
**[Tcl_DStringFree](../TclLib/DString.md)** to free up anything stored here.

### DESCRIPTION

This utility procedure translates a file name to a platform-specific form
which, after being converted to the appropriate encoding, is suitable for
passing to the local operating system. In particular, it converts network names
into native form and does tilde substitution.

However, with the advent of the newer
**[Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath](../TclLib/FileSystem.md)** and
**[Tcl_FSGetNativePath](../TclLib/FileSystem.md)** , there is no longer any
need to use this procedure. In particular,
**[Tcl_FSGetNativePath](../TclLib/FileSystem.md)** performs all the necessary
translation and encoding conversion, is virtual-filesystem aware, and caches
the native result for faster repeated calls. Finally
**[Tcl_FSGetNativePath](../TclLib/FileSystem.md)** does not require you to
free anything afterwards.

If **Tcl_TranslateFileName** has to do tilde substitution or translate the name
then it uses the dynamic string at **bufferPtr* to hold the new string it
generates. After **Tcl_TranslateFileName** returns a non-NULL result, the
caller must eventually invoke **[Tcl_DStringFree](../TclLib/DString.md)** to
free any information placed in **bufferPtr*. The caller need not know whether
or not **Tcl_TranslateFileName** actually used the string;
**Tcl_TranslateFileName** initializes **bufferPtr* even if it does not use it,
so the call to **[Tcl_DStringFree](../TclLib/DString.md)** will be safe in
either case.

If an error occurs (e.g. because there was no user by the given name) then NULL
is returned and an error message will be left in the interpreter's result. When
an error occurs, **Tcl_TranslateFileName** frees the dynamic string itself so
that the caller need not call **[Tcl_DStringFree](../TclLib/DString.md)**.

The caller is responsible for making sure that the interpreter's result has its
default empty value when **Tcl_TranslateFileName** is invoked.
