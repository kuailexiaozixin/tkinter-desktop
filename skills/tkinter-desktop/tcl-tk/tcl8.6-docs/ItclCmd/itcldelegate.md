### NAME

itcl::delegation — delegate methods, procs or options to other objects

Parts of this description are "borrowed" from Tcl extension [snit], as the
functionality is mostly identical.

### WARNING!

This is new functionality in [incr Tcl] where the API can still change!!

### DESCRIPTION

The **delegate** command is used inside an **[incr  Tcl]**
extendedclass/widget/widgetadaptor definition to delegate methods/procs/options
to other objects for handling.

**delegate method** *methodName***to** *componentName* ?**as** *targetName*?
This form of delegate method delegates method methodName to component
componentName. That is, when method methdoNameame is called on an instance of
this type, the method and its arguments will be passed to the named component's
command instead. That is, the following statement

    
    
    delegate method wag to tail

is roughly equivalent to this explicitly defined method:

    
    
    method wag {args} {
        uplevel $tail wag $args
    }

The optional **as** clause allows you to specify the delegated method name and
possibly add some arguments:

    
    
    delegate method wagtail to tail as "wag briskly"

A method cannot be both locally defined and delegated.

**delegate method** *methodName* ?**to** *componentName*? **using** *pattern*
In this form of the delegate statement, the **using** clause is used to specify
the precise form of the command to which method name name is delegated. The
**to** clause is optional, since the chosen command might not involve any
particular component.

The value of the using clause is a list that may contain any or all of the
following substitution codes; these codes are substituted with the described
value to build the delegated command prefix. Note that the following two
statements are equivalent:

    
    
    delegate method wag to tail
    delegate method wag to tail using "%c %m"

Each element of the list becomes a single element of the delegated command
\--it is never reparsed as a string.

Substitutions:

**%%**     This is replaced with a single "%". Thus, to pass the string "%c" to
the command as an argument, you'd write "%%c".

**%c**     This is replaced with the named component's command.

**%j**     This is replaced by the method name; if the name consists of
multiple tokens, they are joined by underscores ("_").

**%m**     This is replaced with the final token of the method name; if the
method name has one token, this is identical to **%M**.

**%M**     This is replaced by the method name; if the name consists of
multiple tokens, they are joined by space characters.

**%n**     This is replaced with the name of the instance's private namespace.

**%s**     This is replaced with the name of the instance command.

**%t**     This is replaced with the fully qualified type name.

**%w**     This is replaced with the original name of the instance command; for
Itcl widgets and widget adaptors, it will be the Tk window name. It remains
constant, even if the instance command is renamed.

**delegate method** *** ?**to** *componentName*? ?**using** *pattern*?
?**except** *methodName methodName ...*?     In this form all unknown method
names are delegeted to the specified component. The except clause can be used
to specify a list of exceptions, i.e., method names that will not be so
delegated. The using clause is defined as given above. In this form, the
statement must contain the to clause, the using clause, or both.

In fact, the "*" can be a list of two or more tokens whose last element is "*",
as in the following example:

    
    
    delegate method {tail *} to tail

This implicitly defines the method tail whose subcommands will be delegated to
the tail component.

The definitions for **delegate proc** ... are the same as for method, the only
difference being, that this is for procs.

**delegate option** *namespec***to** *comp*  

**delegate option namespec to comp as target**  

**delegate option * to** *comp*  

**delegate option * to** *comp***except** *exceptions*     Defines a delegated
option; the namespec is defined as for the option statement. When the
configure, configurelist, or cget instance method is used to set or retrieve
the option's value, the equivalent configure or cget command will be applied to
the component as though the option was defined with the following
**-configuremethod** and **-cgetmethod** :

    
    
    method ConfigureMethod {option value} {
        $comp configure $option $value
    }
    
    method CgetMethod {option} {
        return [$comp cget $option]
    }

Note that delegated options never appear in the **itcl_options** array. If the
as clause is specified, then the target option name is used in place of name.

**delegate** *option****** ?**except** *optionName optionName ...*?     This
form delegates all unknown options to the specified component. The except
clause can be used to specify a list of exceptions, i.e., option names that
will not be so delegated.

**Warning:** options can only be delegated to a component if it supports the
**configure** and **cget** instance methods.

An option cannot be both locally defined and delegated. TBD: Continue from
here.
