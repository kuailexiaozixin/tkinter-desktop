### NAME

itcl::scope — capture the namespace context for a variable

### SYNOPSIS

**itcl::scope** *name*  

### DESCRIPTION

Creates a scoped value for the specified *name* , which must be a variable
name. If the *name* is an instance variable, then the scope command returns a
name which will resolve in any context as an instance variable belonging to
*object*. The precise format of this name is an internal detail to Itcl. Use of
such a scoped value makes it possible to use instance variables in conjunction
with widgets. For example, if you have an object with a private variable `x`,
and you can use `x` in conjunction with the `-textvariable` option of an entry
widget. Before itcl3.0, only common variables could be used in this manner.

If the *name* is not an instance variable, then it must be a common variable or
a global variable. In that case, the scope command returns the fully qualified
name of the variable, e.g., `::foo::bar::x`.

If the *name* is not recognized as a variable, the scope command returns an
error.

Ordinary variable names refer to variables in the global namespace. A scoped
value captures a variable name together with its namespace context in a way
that allows it to be referenced properly later. It is needed, for example, to
wrap up variable names when a Tk widget is used within a namespace:

    
    
    namespace foo {
        private variable mode 1
    
        radiobutton .rb1 -text "Mode #1" 
            -variable [scope mode] -value 1
        pack .rb1
    
        radiobutton .rb2 -text "Mode #2" 
            -variable [scope mode] -value 2
        pack .rb2
    }

Radiobuttons `.rb1` and `.rb2` interact via the variable "mode" contained in
the namespace "foo". The **scope** command guarantees this by returning the
fully qualified variable name `::foo::mode`.

You should never attempt to craft your own scoped variable names, even if you
believe you've flawlessly reverse-engineered the encoding. Instead, you should
always use the scope command to generate the variable name dynamically. Then,
you can pass that name to a widget or to any other bit of code in your program.
