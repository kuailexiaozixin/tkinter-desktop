### NAME

tdbc::tokenize — TDBC SQL tokenizer

### SYNOPSIS

package require **tdbc 1.0**  
  
**tdbc::tokenize** *string*  

### DESCRIPTION

As a convenience to database drivers, Tcl Database Connectivity (TDBC) provides
a command to break SQL code apart into tokens so that bound variables can
readily be identified and substituted.

The **tdbc::tokenize** command accepts as its parameter a string that is
expected to contain one or more SQL statements. It returns a list of
substrings; concatenating these substrings together will yield the original
string. Each substring is one of the following:

  1. A bound variable, which begins with one of the characters '**:** ', '**@** ', or '**$** '. The remainder of the string is the variable name and will consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores. (The leading character will be be non-numeric.) 

  2. A semicolon that separates two SQL statements. 

  3. Something else in a SQL statement. The tokenizer does not attempt to parse SQL; it merely identifies bound variables (distinguishing them from similar strings appearing inside quotes or comments) and statement delimiters.
