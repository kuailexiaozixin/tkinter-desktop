### NAME

Tk_Init, Tk_SafeInit — add Tk to an interpreter and make a new Tk application.

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
int  
**Tk_Init**(*interp*)  
int  
**Tk_SafeInit**(*interp*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter in which to
load Tk. Tk should not already be loaded in this interpreter.

### DESCRIPTION

**Tk_Init** is the package initialization procedure for Tk. It is normally
invoked by the **[Tcl_AppInit](../TclLib/AppInit.md)** procedure for an
application or by the **[load](../TclCmd/load.md)** command. **Tk_Init** adds
all of Tk's commands to *interp* and creates a new Tk application, including
its main window. If the initialization is successful **Tk_Init** returns
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** ; if there is an error it returns
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)**. **Tk_Init** also leaves a result or error
message in interpreter *interp* 's result.

If there is a variable **[argv](../TclCmd/tclvars.md)** in *interp* ,
**Tk_Init** treats the contents of this variable as a list of options for the
new Tk application. The options may have any of the forms documented for the
**[wish](../UserCmd/wish.md)** application (in fact,
**[wish](../UserCmd/wish.md)** uses Tk_Init to process its command-line
arguments).

**Tk_SafeInit** is identical to **Tk_Init** except that it removes all Tk
commands that are considered unsafe. Those commands and the reasons for their
exclusion are:

**bell**     Continuous ringing of the bell is a nuisance.

**clipboard**     A malicious script could replace the contents of the
clipboard with the string “**rm -r *** ” and lead to surprises when the
contents of the clipboard are pasted.

**grab**     Grab can be used to block the user from using any other
applications.

**menu**     Menus can be used to cover the entire screen and to steal input
from the user.

**selection**     See clipboard.

**send**     Send can be used to cause unsafe interpreters to execute commands.

**tk**     The tk command recreates the send command, which is unsafe.

**tkwait**     Tkwait can block the containing process forever

**toplevel**     Toplevels can be used to cover the entire screen and to steal
input from the user.

**wm**     If toplevels are ever allowed, wm can be used to remove decorations,
move windows around, etc.
