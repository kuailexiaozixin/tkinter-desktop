### NAME

Tk_MoveToplevelWindow — Adjust the position of a top-level window

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
**Tk_MoveToplevelWindow(***tkwin, x, y***)**  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tk_Window](../TkLib/WindowId.md) **tkwin** (in)     Token for top-level
window to move.

int **x** (in)     New x-coordinate for the top-left pixel of *tkwin* 's
border, or the top-left pixel of the decorative border supplied for *tkwin* by
the window manager, if there is one.

int **y** (in)     New y-coordinate for the top-left pixel of *tkwin* 's
border, or the top-left pixel of the decorative border supplied for *tkwin* by
the window manager, if there is one.

### DESCRIPTION

In general, a window should never set its own position; this should be done
only by the geometry manger that is responsible for the window. For top-level
windows the window manager is effectively the geometry manager; Tk provides
interface code between the application and the window manager to convey the
application's desires to the geometry manager. The desired size for a top-level
window is conveyed using the usual
**[Tk_GeometryRequest](../TkLib/GeomReq.md)** mechanism. The procedure
**Tk_MoveToplevelWindow** may be used by an application to request a particular
position for a top-level window; this procedure is similar in function to the
**[wm geometry](../TkCmd/wm.md)** Tcl command except that negative offsets
cannot be specified. It is invoked by widgets such as menus that want to appear
at a particular place on the screen.

When **Tk_MoveToplevelWindow** is called it does not immediately pass on the
new desired location to the window manager; it defers this action until all
other outstanding work has been completed, using the
**[Tcl_DoWhenIdle](../TclLib/DoWhenIdle.md)** mechanism.
