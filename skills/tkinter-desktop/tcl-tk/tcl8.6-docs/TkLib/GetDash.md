### NAME

Tk_GetDash — convert from string to valid dash structure.

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tk.h>**  
  
int  
**Tk_GetDash**(*interp, string, dashPtr*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter to use for
error reporting.

const char ***string** (in)     Textual value to be converted.

Tk_Dash ***dashPtr** (out)     Points to place to store the dash pattern value
converted from *string*. Must not be NULL.

### DESCRIPTION

These procedure parses the string and fills in the result in the Tk_Dash
structure. The string can be a list of integers or a character string
containing only “**.,-_** ” and spaces. If all goes well,
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned and a dash descriptor is stored
in the variable pointed to by *dashPtr*. If *string* does not have the proper
syntax then **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned, an error message
is left in the interpreter's result, and nothing is stored at **dashPtr*.

The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element represents the
number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd segments are drawn using the
“outline” color. The other segments are drawn transparent.

The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5 possible
characters “**.,-_** ”. The space can be used to enlarge the space between
other line elements, and can not occur in the first position of the string.
Some examples:

    
    
    -dash .     = -dash {2 4}
        -dash -     = -dash {6 4}
        -dash -.    = -dash {6 4 2 4}
        -dash -..   = -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
        -dash {. }  = -dash {2 8}
        -dash ,     = -dash {4 4}

The main difference between this syntax and the numeric is that it is shape-
conserving. This means that all values in the dash list will be multiplied by
the line width before display. This ensures that “.” will always be displayed
as a dot and “-” always as a dash regardless of the line width.

On systems where only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash pattern will be
displayed as the most close dash pattern that is available. For example, on
Windows only the first 4 of the above examples are available; the last 2
examples will be displayed identically to the first one.
