### DESCRIPTION

These procedures are intended for access to the multiple interpreter facility
from inside C programs. They enable managing multiple interpreters in a
hierarchical relationship, and the management of aliases, commands that when
invoked in one interpreter execute a command in another interpreter. The return
value for those procedures that return an **int** is either
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** or **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)**. If
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned then the interpreter's result
contains an error message.

**Tcl_CreateSlave** creates a new interpreter as a child of *interp*. It also
creates a child command named *childName* in *interp* which allows *interp* to
manipulate the new child. If *isSafe* is zero, the command creates a trusted
child in which Tcl code has access to all the Tcl commands. If it is **1** ,
the command creates a “safe” child in which Tcl code has access only to set of
Tcl commands defined as “Safe Tcl”; see the manual entry for the Tcl
**[interp](../TclCmd/interp.md)** command for details. If the creation of the
new child interpreter failed, **NULL** is returned.

**Tcl_CreateChild** is a synonym for **Tcl_CreateSlave**.

**Tcl_IsSafe** returns **1** if *interp* is “safe” (was created with the
**TCL_SAFE_INTERPRETER** flag specified), **0** otherwise.

**Tcl_MakeSafe** marks *interp* as “safe”, so that future calls to
**Tcl_IsSafe** will return 1. It also removes all known potentially-unsafe core
functionality (both commands and variables) from *interp*. However, it cannot
know what parts of an extension or application are safe and does not make any
attempt to remove those parts, so safety is not guaranteed after calling
**Tcl_MakeSafe**. Callers will want to take care with their use of
**Tcl_MakeSafe** to avoid false claims of safety. For many situations,
**Tcl_CreateSlave** may be a better choice, since it creates interpreters in a
known-safe state.

**Tcl_GetSlave** returns a pointer to a child interpreter of *interp*. The
child interpreter is identified by *childName*. If no such child interpreter
exists, **NULL** is returned.

**Tcl_GetChild** is a synonym for **Tcl_GetSlave**.

**Tcl_GetMaster** returns a pointer to the master interpreter of *interp*. If
*interp* has no master (it is a top-level interpreter) then **NULL** is
returned.

**Tcl_GetParent** is a synonym for **Tcl_GetMaster**.

**Tcl_GetInterpPath** stores in the result of *interp* the relative path
between *interp* and *childInterp* ; *childInterp* must be a child of *interp*.
If the computation of the relative path succeeds,
**[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned, else
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** is returned and an error message is stored
as the result of *interp*.

**Tcl_CreateAlias** creates a command named *childCmd* in *childInterp* that
when invoked, will cause the command *targetCmd* to be invoked in
*targetInterp*. The arguments specified by the strings contained in *argv* are
always prepended to any arguments supplied in the invocation of *childCmd* and
passed to *targetCmd*. This operation returns **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)**
if it succeeds, or **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** if it fails; in that
case, an error message is left in the value result of *childInterp*. Note that
there are no restrictions on the ancestry relationship (as created by
**Tcl_CreateSlave**) between *childInterp* and *targetInterp*. Any two
interpreters can be used, without any restrictions on how they are related.

**Tcl_CreateAliasObj** is similar to **Tcl_CreateAlias** except that it takes a
vector of values to pass as additional arguments instead of a vector of
strings.

**Tcl_GetAliasObj** returns information in the form of a pointer to a vector of
[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) structures about an alias *aliasName* in
*interp*. Any of the result fields can be **NULL** , in which case the
corresponding datum is not returned. If a result field is non-**NULL** , the
address indicated is set to the corresponding datum. For example, if
*targetCmdPtr* is non-**NULL** it is set to a pointer to the string containing
the name of the target command.

**Tcl_GetAlias** is similar to **Tcl_GetAliasObj** except that it returns a
pointer to a vector of string instead of a vector of
[Tcl_Obj](../TclLib/Object.md) structures. **Tcl_GetAlias** is deprecated.

**Tcl_ExposeCommand** moves the command named *hiddenCmdName* from the set of
hidden commands to the set of exposed commands, putting it under the name
*cmdName*. *HiddenCmdName* must be the name of an existing hidden command, or
the operation will return **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and leave an
error message as the result of *interp*. If an exposed command named *cmdName*
already exists, the operation returns **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and
leaves an error message as the result of *interp*. If the operation succeeds,
it returns **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)**. After executing this command,
attempts to use *cmdName* in any script evaluation mechanism will again
succeed.

**Tcl_HideCommand** moves the command named *cmdName* from the set of exposed
commands to the set of hidden commands, under the name *hiddenCmdName*.
*CmdName* must be the name of an existing exposed command, or the operation
will return **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and leave an error message as
the result of *interp*. Currently both *cmdName* and *hiddenCmdName* must not
contain namespace qualifiers, or the operation will return
**[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and leave an error message as the result
of *interp*. The *CmdName* will be looked up in the global namespace, and not
relative to the current namespace, even if the current namespace is not the
global one. If a hidden command whose name is *hiddenCmdName* already exists,
the operation also returns **[TCL_ERROR](../TclCmd/catch.md)** and an error
message is left as the result of *interp*. If the operation succeeds, it
returns **[TCL_OK](../TclCmd/catch.md)**. After executing this command,
attempts to use *cmdName* in any script evaluation mechanism will fail.
