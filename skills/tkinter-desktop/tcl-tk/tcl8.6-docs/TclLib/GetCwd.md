### NAME

Tcl_GetCwd, Tcl_Chdir — manipulate the current working directory

### SYNOPSIS

**#include <tcl.h>**  
char *  
**Tcl_GetCwd**(*interp* , *bufferPtr*)  
int  
**Tcl_Chdir**(*dirName*)  

### ARGUMENTS

[Tcl_Interp](../TclLib/Interp.md) ***interp** (in)     Interpreter in which to
report an error, if any.

[Tcl_DString](../TclLib/DString.md) ***bufferPtr** (in/out)     This dynamic
string is used to store the current working directory. At the time of the call
it should be uninitialized or free. The caller must eventually call
**[Tcl_DStringFree](../TclLib/DString.md)** to free up anything stored here.

const char ***dirName** (in)     File path in UTF-8 format.

### DESCRIPTION

These procedures may be used to manipulate the current working directory for
the application. They provide C-level access to the same functionality as the
Tcl **[pwd](../TclCmd/pwd.md)** command.

**Tcl_GetCwd** returns a pointer to a string specifying the current directory,
or NULL if the current directory could not be determined. If NULL is returned,
an error message is left in the *interp* 's result. Storage for the result
string is allocated in bufferPtr; the caller must call
**[Tcl_DStringFree()](../TclLib/DString.md)** when the result is no longer
needed. The format of the path is UTF-8.

**Tcl_Chdir** changes the applications current working directory to the value
specified in *dirName*. The format of the passed in string must be UTF-8. The
function returns -1 on error or 0 on success.
